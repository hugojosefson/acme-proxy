# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Compatibility

**Before 1.0.0, the database schema is the only compatibility guarantee.**
`migrations/` is append-only: a schema change is a new migration file, never an
edit to a committed one. Upgrading is therefore just starting the new binary
against the existing database — there is no dump/restore step, and no upgrade
procedure beyond replacing the binary.

Everything else may change in any release: configuration keys, profile names and
the ACME URLs derived from them, the admin JSON API, log event names, and the
CLI. That is deliberate — it is what lets the design keep improving instead of
carrying a compatibility layer for every shape it has ever had. In exchange:

- **Every such change is listed here**, under the release's `### Breaking`
  heading, with the old spelling and the new one.
- **A removed or renamed configuration key is refused by name at startup**
  wherever practical, so an unmigrated configuration stops the server instead of
  coming up looking configured. That refusal is a one-line error message, not a
  compatibility layer — there are no aliases, no dual syntax and no legacy
  lowering, and the refusals themselves go away at 1.0.0.

Read this section before an upgrade, and `acme-proxy filter show` builds a
`[filter]` policy exactly as startup does, so it is the cheapest way to check a
migrated configuration before restarting.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

The DNS-01 changes are:

- DNS-01 cleanup removes only the supplied TXT value. RFC 2136 responses must
  have correct TSIG authentication and come from the configured UDP peer.
- DNS-01 waits for public TXT propagation before CA validation. Configuration
  settings control UPDATE, propagation, cleanup, and relay attempt deadlines.
  Cancellation starts bounded cleanup after the UPDATE finishes.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-08

### Breaking

- **Admin commands now distinguish two failure exit codes.** Every failure
  previously exited `1`. Now `1` means *the host could not carry out the
  request* (a database or signer error, an unreadable file, a socket that would
  not bind, an unreachable upstream, invalid configuration) and `3` means *the
  request cannot be satisfied as written* (no such id, a resource in the wrong
  state, an unknown `--status`/`--event`/`--outcome`/`--role` value, or
  contradictory flags) — a class where re-running the identical command cannot
  succeed. `0` (success) and the argument parser's `2` (bad command line) are
  unchanged. A script testing `if acme-proxy … ; then` is unaffected; one that
  matched `$? -eq 1` for "not found" must now also accept `3`. Documented at
  [Admin CLI → Exit codes](operations/cli.md). Supplying nothing on stdin where
  a password or an EAB key was asked for is in the second class, beside the
  unusable-value refusal next to it.

- **A web-admin operator's username must match `^[a-z0-9._-]+$`.** It is a URL
  segment on the panel (`/ui/operators/{username}/…`), so a name holding `/`,
  `?`, `#` or a space produced links and routes that could never match — the
  operator was creatable from the host and then unmanageable from the panel.
  Refused by name at `acme-proxy admin user create`; existing rows are
  untouched, since refusing to *load* a username would lock somebody out of a
  panel they are already using.

- **Reading the `/operators` surface now requires the `admin` tier**, matching
  its writes. `GET /api/operators`, `/api/operators/{username}`,
  `/api/operators/{username}/sessions` and the two `/ui` pages answered any
  signed-in operator, which let a `viewer` read every colleague's role and
  contact address, the addresses each recently signed in from, and every live
  session's fingerprint and address. The Operators nav entry is hidden below
  `admin`, and the per-row controls on the other pages are hidden from a
  `viewer` — the gate is still the extractor, but a button that always answers
  `403` is a worse page than no button.

- **Demoting the last `admin` is refused.** `/operators/*` is `admin`-only on
  both web surfaces, so a deployment with none cannot manage operators from the
  panel at all. `acme-proxy admin user role <them> viewer` now says so instead
  of leaving it to be discovered; promoting somebody else first is the fix, and
  the host CLI can always undo it either way.

### Added

- **The audit trail now records administrative actions, not just certificate
  ones.** `audit_log` answered one question — who asked the CA to sign or
  withdraw a certificate — in four event names. It now also records what an
  operator (or the host CLI) does to the CA: an account deactivated, its
  contact rewritten or the account deleted; an EAB credential minted or
  revoked; an operator created, disabled, enabled, deleted, their role,
  password or contact changed, their second factor enrolled, disabled or
  reset, their recovery codes reissued; a session or every session revoked; a
  background job cancelled or advanced; the nonce table or the audit log
  itself pruned. Twenty-one new `AuditEvent` names, each recorded only on
  success and attributed to `actor_kind = "admin"` (with the operator's
  username and resolved address) from the web panel or `"cli"` from the host.
  They appear in the same `acme-proxy audit list` / `GET /api/audit` /
  `/ui/audit` surfaces, filter by `--event`, and are pruned by the same
  `audit cleanup` / `audit.retention_days`; the web audit surface stays
  read-only. A new migration
  (`20260909120000_audit_log_admin_actions.sql`) rebuilds `audit_log` to drop
  the `CHECK (event IN (…))` constraint — `crate::audit::AuditEvent` is the
  vocabulary's sole authority now, the `admin_users.role` precedent — while
  keeping the `outcome` and `actor_kind` checks. No configuration key: like
  the rest of `[audit]`, recording who administered the CA is not optional.

- **`order list` can be searched by identifier and by certificate serial** —
  the two questions an operator arrives with from an out-of-band report. `order
  list --identifier <name>` matches an order's identifier **exactly**
  (case-insensitive), so a misissuance hunt for `example.com` is not answered
  with `evil-example.com`; `--identifier-contains <text>` is the substring form
  for a half-remembered name, and the two are mutually exclusive.
  `--cert-serial <hex>` finds the order whose issued leaf carries that serial —
  the value `audit list --cert-serial` already filters on. All three are also
  query parameters on `GET /api/orders` (`identifier`, `identifierContains`,
  `certSerial`) and filter controls on `/ui/orders`, and all three are refused
  by name beside `--expiring-in`, which is a different query. No schema change:
  the identifier match is a `json_each` scan over `orders.identifiers`.

- **`acme-proxy admin session revoke` can end a single session**, not only
  every session one operator holds or every session on the server. The new
  `--session <id>` takes the fingerprint the listing prints and is scoped to
  `--user`, which clap enforces (and excludes `--all`), since
  `AdminSession::find_by_user_and_fingerprint` resolves a fingerprint only
  within one operator's rows. It reuses the same model calls the panel's
  "revoke this session" buttons already make, so the terminal and the two web
  surfaces now revoke at the same grain. Not confirm-gated: revocation only
  ever tightens, like `order revoke`.

### Fixed

- **Every audit row the web admin wrote carried no client address.**
  `record_admin_action` reads the address from the `ClientIp` request
  extension, which is inserted by the ACME filter middleware — a layer the
  admin listener deliberately does not run. So all ~25 administrative events
  from the panel stored `NULL` for both the address and its reverse name, while
  `CHANGELOG`, `CLAUDE.md` and the ASVS assessment all said they carried them.
  The extension is now seeded by the server-wide access middleware from the
  peer address it already resolves for the request span, and the filter
  middleware still overwrites it on the ACME side with the `ProxyPolicy`
  answer.

- **`acme-proxy order delete` wrote no audit row**, alone among the three front
  ends that can hard-delete an order.

- **`acme-proxy account delete`'s audit row always said `0 order(s)
  cascaded`.** It counted the account's orders *after* the delete, by which
  point the `ON DELETE CASCADE` had removed them. The count now travels out of
  the confirmation, where it was already computed to word the prompt.

- **Finishing a second-factor enrolment from `/ui` wrote no
  `operator_totp_enrolled` row**, where the identical action through
  `POST /api/mfa/totp/confirm` wrote one. The audit row and the operator
  notification are now emitted by a single call, so one cannot be written
  without the other.

- **`acme-proxy jobs cancel` on an already-`failed` relay job re-abandoned its
  order**, writing a second `certificate_issue_failed` row for one issuance and
  overwriting `upstream_orders.error` — the upstream CA's own message, and the
  reason `upstream order show` exists — with "issuance cancelled by operator".
  A `failed` relay job was already abandoned when the runner retired it, so
  cancelling one is now an ordinary `job_cancelled`. Cancelling a relay job
  whose order has been swept likewise no longer reports an abandonment that did
  not happen, and does write the `job_cancelled` row it previously skipped.

- **`--cert-serial` and `?certSerial=` were case-sensitive** against a column
  that only ever holds lowercase unseparated hex, so a serial pasted from
  `openssl x509 -serial` or an abuse report answered with a silent empty page.
  Uppercase, colon- and space-separated forms are now folded at the four
  operator entry points.

- **`[admin.notify]`'s environment variables did not work.** None of its five
  list-valued keys was registered for list parsing, so the documented
  `ACME_PROXY_ADMIN__NOTIFY__ENABLED=email` (and every sibling) failed to
  deserialize instead of configuring anything.

- **A rate-limited step-up on `/ui` lost its `Retry-After` header.** The page
  rebuilt the response from the error's status, code and message, which dropped
  every header the error carried.

- Session revocations that ride along with a change — a password, a role, a
  disable — now leave their own `session_revoked` row, carrying how many
  sessions went; `SessionScope`'s own documentation already said they did.
  `nonce cleanup` no longer writes a row for a sweep that removed nothing,
  matching `audit cleanup`. The admin page-panic log line carries
  `surface = "ui"` like every other page-side event rather than `"page"`, and
  `user_agent_of` applies the same 256-character cap the audit path does to a
  header an unauthenticated caller supplies.

### Security

- **The `webhook` notifier caps the response body it reads.** It collected the
  whole of whatever the receiving endpoint sent, to take a 200-character excerpt
  off the front of it for an error message. Every other outbound client in the
  tree already stops at `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` (1 MiB) — `ipam::http`,
  `signer::relay::client`, `challenge::http_01` — and this one now does too,
  reusing the shared `error_excerpt` while it is there. The delivery timeout
  bounded how *long* a hostile or malfunctioning receiver could hold the
  connection open and said nothing about how much memory it could spend, once
  per attempt, across `jobs.max_concurrent` workers and `jobs.max_attempts`
  retries. A body over the cap now reads as "no diagnosis available"; the
  response status alone still decides the delivery outcome and the
  retryable/permanent split, exactly as before.

- **An identifier that would be misread by a `custom` filter script is now
  refused.** `ACME_FILTER_IDENTIFIERS` comma-joins the identifier values into
  one string with no escaping, and `well_formed_name` is documented as refusing
  delimiters for exactly that reason — but it validates the *order*'s
  identifiers, and the CSR stage passes a list that also carries the certificate
  request's subject `CommonName`. A CN is arbitrary text and is checked only for
  looking like a DNS name the order does not cover, so one holding a comma or a
  newline went through as an ordinary human label and reached a script as extra
  entries. Such a request is now `badCSR`, refused before the script is spawned;
  the refusal names the identifier's *type* and never echoes its value. Nothing
  changes without a `custom` check in the rule set: the value is untouched for
  `filter.identifiers`' `deny` patterns and for the typed JSON on stdin.
  `ACME_SIGNER_IDENTIFIERS` and `ACME_NOTIFY_IDENTIFIERS` needed no equivalent —
  both join order identifiers, which are already validated.

- **`pemfile::write_atomic` creates its scratch file with `O_EXCL`.** It opened
  the path with `create(true)`, which applies the requested mode only when it
  actually creates the file and which follows a symlink when it does not. A
  leftover scratch file therefore decided the permissions of a file the function
  documents as owner-controlled, and one planted as a symlink redirected the
  write — which for the CRL means somebody able to write the server's data
  directory but not read it could choose where relying parties' revocation data
  went. The path is now unlinked and then created with `create_new`, so the mode
  always applies and a link is removed rather than followed. A stale temporary
  still does not wedge later writes, which is what the previous spelling was for.
  (The two tests covering this pre-created `path.with_extension("tmp")`, which is
  not the name the function uses — they were passing against a path nothing
  touched, and now use the real one.)

- **A `custom` hook's output is bounded.** `ScriptHook` read the child's stdout
  and stderr with no ceiling, so a script in a loop cost memory limited only by
  the hook timeout — on the `filter` and `ipam` hooks, once per request. Each
  stream is now capped at 1 MiB and a script past it fails with a named error
  rather than being silently truncated, which on the `signer` hook would have
  surfaced as an unparsable certificate. The new `ScriptError::OutputTooLarge`
  joins the existing variants at both call sites that match them one by one: a
  retryable server-side failure, never a denial and never an inventory answer.

- **The `/operators` surface asks for the caller's password even when they have
  no second factor.** It ran `check_step_up`, which passes unconditionally for
  an operator with no factor — correct on the MFA routes, where a first
  enrolment protects nothing, and wrong here: this surface's blast radius is a
  *colleague's* account, which exists either way. A password-only `admin`
  holding a stolen cookie could disable every other admin and wipe their second
  factors without typing anything, while the panel rendered a `required`
  "Confirm your password" field that was ignored. The four routes now call
  `verify_current_password`, the unconditional check
  `account::change_password` already used for its own ASVS V6.2.3 reason.

- **The web admin now notifies an operator about security events on their own
  account** — ASVS 5.0 **V6.3.5** and **V6.3.7**, the two open L3 gaps in the
  [ASVS assessment](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/asvs.html)
  for authentication notifications. A completed sign-in from an address the
  operator's recent sign-ins did not come from, a correct password followed by
  a refused second factor, a per-session second-factor lockout, and any change
  to their password or second factor now send a message. Delivery is the same
  durable, retrying `notify` pipeline every other event uses, configured under
  the new **`[admin.notify]`** section (email / webhook / custom, the shape of
  `[notify]`); email goes to each operator's own address, set with
  `acme-proxy admin user create --contact` or `admin user contact` and stored
  in the new nullable `admin_users.contact_email` column (a new migration). Two
  `NotifyEvent` kinds carry it — `admin_sign_in` and
  `admin_credential_changed` — bringing the total to nine. Credential changes
  made from the **host CLI** (`admin user passwd`, `admin user totp reset`) are
  still logged only; the host is the trusted plane. `admin_users` also gains a
  `known_login_ips` column (the last five distinct login addresses, compared
  only to decide whether to notify, never to authorise).

- **The container image now runs as a non-root user** — ASVS 5.0 V13.2.2, the
  last open L1/L2 gap in the [ASVS
  assessment](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/asvs.html). The
  `Containerfile`'s final stage now adds an `acme-proxy` user (uid/gid `1000`)
  that owns `/data` and nothing else, plus a `USER` line — everything the
  server writes (the database, the CA key material, the CRL and its ledger, a
  generated TLS cert, a mounted `config.toml`) already lands in that one
  directory. This is the image the e2e lab builds *and* the one
  [Deployment](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/getting_started/deployment.html)
  points container users at, so it is hardened rather than demoted to
  lab-only. **On upgrade**, a bind-mounted data directory must be writable by
  uid `1000`: add `:U` to the mount under rootless Podman (`-v ./data:/data:U`),
  or `chown 1000:1000 ./data` for Docker.

- **A CycloneDX SBOM now ships with the source** — ASVS 5.0 V15.1.2, another
  open L1/L2 gap in the [ASVS
  assessment](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/asvs.html).
  `sbom.cdx.json` at the repository root is a committed CycloneDX 1.5 inventory
  of the dependency closure that ships in the binary (`--all-features --target
  all`, so the `hsm`/`cryptoki` path and every platform-gated crate are
  covered; dev-dependencies excluded). It is carried in the published crate,
  and a new `sbom` CI job regenerates it and fails on any drift from
  `Cargo.lock`, the same ratchet as the coverage floor. `cargo deny check`
  already gated that closure for advisories, licences and sources; this
  publishes it, so "is this build affected by RUSTSEC-…" no longer means
  reconstructing the graph from the tree.

- **Web-admin operators now have a role** — ASVS 5.0 V7.5.3 and V8.4.2. Three
  tiers on `admin_users.role`: `viewer` reads every page and API route and may
  still act on its own account (password, sessions, second factor, logout) but
  is refused every shared or CA mutation; `operator` adds every CA action
  (revoke a certificate, deactivate or delete an ACME account, delete an order,
  mint or revoke EAB, run a nonce sweep) but not the `/operators/*`
  colleague-management surface; `admin` is refused nothing. Enforced in the
  three write-side session extractors (`AuthenticatedWrite` → `operator`+,
  `AdminWrite` → `admin`, `SelfServiceWrite` → any), so a mutating route cannot
  reach a session without stating a tier. **A `NULL` column reads as `admin`**,
  so upgrading changes no existing operator's authority and the bootstrap
  operator is never locked out. Set from the host: `acme-proxy admin user
  create --role admin|operator|viewer` (default `admin`) and a new `admin user
  role <username> <tier>` (which revokes the operator's sessions, like `passwd`
  and `disable`). The CLI itself enforces no tier — the host shell is the
  trusted plane, the same as it already is for `status`.

- **A panicking handler now answers a document instead of dropping the
  connection** — ASVS 5.0 V16.5.4. A `tower_http` `CatchPanicLayer` on each
  listener catches an unexpected panic in a route handler, logs it once as
  `request_handler_panicked` (`error`, with a `listener` / `surface` field),
  and returns that listener's own error shape: an ACME `serverInternal` problem
  document on the ACME listener, and — split by surface, the way the `/api`
  and page fallbacks already are — the JSON admin error on `/api` or the HTML
  error document on `/ui`. The panic message goes to the log only, never the
  response body. `panic = "abort"` remains unset so the layer can unwind.

- **The panel can now list and revoke sessions, and manage other operators**
  — ASVS 5.0 V7.5.2 and V7.4.5. The account page gains a Sessions card: every
  one of the caller's own live sessions, the current one labelled, each
  individually revocable, plus "Sign out everywhere" (previously an unlinked
  API route). A new **Operators** page lists every operator and lets one act
  on a *colleague's* account — disable, enable, reset their second factor,
  and revoke one of their sessions individually. Every mutation there
  re-proves the caller's own password and refuses to target the caller —
  managing yourself stays on the account page, which already owns it. `admin user
  create`/`passwd` stay host-only, unchanged: those mint a credential, which
  is where "no sign-up page" already draws the line.

  Until the role column landed (above), any signed-in operator could disable
  or reset the factor of any other; that surface is now `admin`-only, and a
  `viewer` cannot reach it at all.

- **An operator can now change their own password from the panel**, not only
  from `acme-proxy admin user passwd` on the host — ASVS 5.0 V6.2.2. The route
  takes the *current* password and verifies it before writing a new one
  (V6.2.3), which the CLI command never needed to: it already runs as the
  process trusted to rewrite the row, where a web request is not. That check
  runs unconditionally, even for an operator with no second factor — unlike
  the existing step-up gate on the TOTP routes, which is deliberately skipped
  when there is nothing yet to protect.

  Guessing the current password is bounded by the same rate limiter and the
  same bucket the second-factor step-up and sign-in itself share, so a fourth
  call site buys no extra budget. The new password still goes through
  `check_password_policy`, the same rules `admin user create`/`passwd`
  enforce.

  Unlike the CLI command, which revokes every session the operator holds, the
  panel's own change keeps the session that made it signed in and revokes
  every *other* one — the same shape the second-factor routes already use, so
  the panel does not sign its own operator out mid-edit.

### Documentation

- **The HSTS scope of the web admin's own host is now spelled out.** Every
  response carries `includeSubDomains`, which is what ASVS 3.4.1 asks for at L2
  and is right when the panel has a host of its own — and is a wider commitment
  than an operator may realise when `admin.base_url` names an apex, since it
  then pins every sibling subdomain to HTTPS for a year and is not scoped by
  port. The web admin page now says to give the panel a dedicated name and why
  there is no configuration key for the header, and the ASVS row links to it. No
  code change: gating the header on TLS would have removed only a header a
  browser already ignores over plain HTTP, and would not have touched the case
  that actually bites.

- **A secret rotation schedule is now documented** — ASVS 5.0 V13.1.4, the last
  open L3 configuration gap, and the reason V11.1.1 (documented key lifecycle)
  sat at partial. A new [Secret
  Rotation](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/rotation.html) page
  gives a recommended interval and the early-rotation triggers for every secret
  in the [security
  model](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/index.html)'s
  inventory, with the CA key called out as the one whose practice is structural
  rather than scheduled. No code change.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-27

### Breaking

- **Row ids are UUID version 7, stored as sixteen bytes rather than
  thirty-six characters.** Two changes at once, and neither is visible from
  outside the server: an id is still rendered by `Uuid::to_string`, so account
  URLs, `kid`s, order URLs and every admin API member are byte-identical, and
  the upgrade is still just starting the new binary.

  Version 7's leading 48 bits are a millisecond timestamp, so ids created close
  together share a prefix. An id index is written at its right-hand edge rather
  than at a fresh random leaf per insert, and the `ORDER BY created_at, id`
  tie-break the seven paged listings use on a whole-second `created_at` now
  falls out chronological where a v4 gave a fresh random permutation per pair.
  The motive is the PostgreSQL backend (`TODO.md`), where a random primary key
  costs a page split and a full-page WAL write per row and where the same type
  maps to a native `uuid` column.

  The storage change is a **rebuild of ten tables in place** — `accounts`,
  `orders`, `authorizations`, `challenges`, `eab_keys`, `upstream_orders`,
  `admin_users`, `admin_sessions`, `admin_recovery_codes` and `jobs` — done now
  because no deployment exists to be careful of, and it is not reversible.
  Existing rows keep the v4 ids they were minted with: an id is a foreign key,
  a `kid` is a credential a client stored, and an order id is inside a URL a
  client polls for weeks. So a table holds both versions, and only the v7s sort
  by creation.

  Four columns look like ids and are deliberately left as text —
  `orders.replaces` (an RFC 9773 certID), `audit_log.actor_id` (an account id
  *or* an admin username), and `audit_log.account_id` / `order_id`, which name
  a row that may already be gone rather than pointing at one.

  What an operator has to change is **ad-hoc SQL**. An id column prints as a
  blob and no longer compares equal to a quoted string:

  ```bash
  sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT lower(hex(id)), status FROM orders
                      WHERE account_id = unhex(replace('<the id>','-',''));"
  ```

  `acme-proxy account list`, `order list` and the admin API are unaffected and
  remain the intended way in. One smaller thing goes with it: an id rendered
  into a log line loses the quotation marks `String`'s `Debug` put around it.

- **The IPAM custom-field defaults are renamed.** `ipam.netbox.custom_field`
  now defaults to **`acme_domains`** (was `acme_allowed_names`), and
  `ipam.phpipam.custom_field` to **`custom_acme_domains`** (was
  `custom_acme_allowed_names`, keeping phpIPAM's mandatory `custom_` column
  prefix). The two moved together: they name the same thing in two inventories
  and reading as though they did not was the whole problem. The key itself is
  unchanged, so a deployment that spells `custom_field` out in its configuration
  is untouched — and that is also why this one is **not** refused by name at
  startup like a renamed key: nothing about the configuration is stale to look
  at, only its unset value moved. A deployment relying on the default either
  renames the field in NetBox / the column in phpIPAM, or pins the old name:

  ```toml
  [ipam.netbox]
  custom_field = "acme_allowed_names"
  ```

  Left unmigrated, the inventory answers with the field absent, which the
  backends read as "this address is entitled to no extra names" — the addresses
  keep whatever their `dns_name`/`hostname` permits and lose the rest, so the
  symptom is a refused `newOrder` rather than a startup failure.

- **`eab list`, `admin user list` and `admin session list` answer a page, not
  a bare array.** All three now take `--limit`/`--offset`, print the
  `N of M row(s)` footer, and under `--json` answer the
  `{items, total, limit, offset}` envelope every other listing — and the admin
  API — already answers. A script reading `acme-proxy eab list --json | jq '.[]'`
  reads `jq '.items[]'` instead.

  They were the last three bare arrays, kept that way on the argument that an
  operator mints those rows by hand a few at a time. That was true of how the
  tables fill and said nothing about how long they have been filling; what it
  cost was a script learning one shape for the shell and another for `/api`.
  `render::print_rows`, the renderer that produced the bare shape, is gone with
  them: `print_page` is now the only listing shape in the binary.

  `admin user list` stays **oldest first** and is the one listing that is: the
  bootstrap operator, created before there was a panel to sign in to, is
  precisely the row whose position should not move as colleagues are added.

- **`GET /api/eab` is newest first.** It was oldest first, and the reason
  recorded at the query was that flipping it would make the API disagree with
  `/ui/eab` and `eab list`, which both still read an unpaged `Eab::list_all`.
  Both read `Eab::search` now, so that reason expired, and what settles the
  direction instead is the mint form: `POST /ui/eab` re-renders the first page
  out of band so a new credential appears without a reload — which is only the
  right page if the listing puts it on top. The `created_at` tie-break moved to
  `kid DESC` for the same reason, a `kid` being a UUID v7: ascending, it handed
  back the *oldest* of the credentials minted inside one second, which is
  exactly the second the form re-renders in.

### Added

- **An operator surface for the background job queue, and for the relay
  signer's orders in flight.** Neither front end mentioned `jobs` at all, so
  "why is this order still `processing`?" ended at `sqlite3` — on the one
  subsystem whose whole purpose is surviving the failures an operator gets
  paged about. New:

  - **`acme-proxy jobs list|show|cancel|run-now`** — `list` filters by `--kind`
    and `--status` (the latter refused by name), `show` cross-links a
    `signer_relay_issue` job to its upstream order, `cancel` is confirm-gated,
    `run-now` nudges a `ready` job's schedule or revives a `failed` one for
    exactly one more attempt. On the web admin: `GET /api/jobs`,
    `GET /api/jobs/{id}`, `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel`,
    `POST /api/jobs/{id}/run`, and `/ui/jobs` with a detail card carrying the
    two mutations and the upstream cross-link panel.
  - **`acme-proxy upstream order list|show`** — the relay's `upstream_orders`
    table (upstream URLs, the upstream's own error text, the finalize request's
    `request_id`), read-only. On the web admin: `GET /api/upstream-orders`,
    `GET /api/upstream-orders/{id}` and `/ui/upstream-orders`, cross-linked back
    to the relay job. The stored CSR is never rendered.
  - Cancelling an in-flight `signer_relay_issue` job **also abandons the ACME
    order**: the local order is marked `invalid` (a generic problem document,
    so the client stops polling), the upstream mapping is marked `invalid` so
    restart recovery does not resurrect it, and one `certificate_issue_failed`
    audit row is written attributed to the operator. This shares
    `flow::abandon_relayed_order` with the runner's own `RelayJob::abandon`.
  - `jobs.status = 'cancelled'` was a declared-but-unwritten value since the
    table was added; it is now written, only by this surface. Cancelling a
    periodic sweep job stops that sweep until the server restarts, which the
    CLI and UI warn about.

- **`--log-level <off|error|warn|info|debug|trace>`**, a third global CLI flag
  beside `--yes` and `--color`. It is how an admin command is asked for log
  records now that it emits none by default (below), and on `serve` it outranks
  both `RUST_LOG` and `logging.filter` — a flag was typed where the other two
  are ambient, the same reasoning that has `--color always` outrank `NO_COLOR`.
  The level covers `acme-proxy` alone, so it never turns on a dependency's
  logging by accident; `RUST_LOG` stays the way to write a directive that
  reaches further. It survives a `SIGHUP`, and `server_logging_filter_overridden`
  gains a `source` field naming which of the two overrode an edited
  `logging.filter`.

- **The last few asymmetries between the two front ends are closed.** Four
  commands, each of them a thing one surface could do and its twin could not:

  - **`acme-proxy admin user show <username> [--json]`** — an operator was the
    only listable object in the binary with no detail command. It carries the
    two things a row cannot: whether enrolment was *started and never
    confirmed*, and how many recovery codes are left. The first matters because
    "pending" and "no factor" behave identically at the login prompt, so an
    operator who believes they enrolled has no other way to find out.
    `admin user totp status` still says the same thing about the factor alone.
  - **`acme-proxy order chain <id>`** — the issued chain, as PEM, and nothing
    else, so it pipes: `order chain <id> > web.example.com.pem`. The panel has
    offered `GET /ui/orders/{id}/chain.pem` since 0.3.0, so a host holding the
    database was going through a browser for bytes it already had. It keeps
    that route's rule that an order which never reached issuance is an error
    rather than an empty file — zero bytes named `.pem` read as a broken
    certificate, not an absent one.
  - **`acme-proxy nonce count [--json]`** — the table size and the window a
    nonce is fresh for, `GET /api/nonces`'s exact `{count, ttlSeconds}` from the
    one renderer both now call. The shell could sweep the table and not look at
    it. Neither surface ever lists *values*: a nonce is a bearer credential
    until it is consumed.
  - **`acme-proxy profile list [--json]`** — the ACME endpoints this
    configuration mounts, name-sorted, each with its directory URL and whether
    it bypasses challenge validation or requires EAB. It renders the same
    document `GET /api/profiles` does, from the opposite direction: the API
    reads the *mounted* profiles, where the CLI resolves the configuration,
    because building the real thing constructs signer backends — generating a
    CA key and contacting a relay's upstream for a read-only listing. That is
    `filter show`'s split, with its two consequences: the panel is right about
    what is running, and only the terminal can be pointed at a configuration
    the server would refuse to start on.

- **`/ui/eab` is paged.** It read the whole table; it now reads the same
  windowed query `GET /api/eab` and `eab list` do, so the three cannot come to
  describe the credential set differently. The `/ui/` overview's EAB count
  stops loading every row to call `.len()` on it, which the comment above it
  already claimed it did not.

### Fixed

- **A `relay` profile issues again against Let's Encrypt.** Let's Encrypt now
  poses `dns-persist-01` alongside `http-01`/`dns-01`/`tls-alpn-01` in every
  authorization, and that challenge type carries **no `token`** — its TXT value
  derives from the account URI, which is the whole point of the method. The
  relay's model of an upstream challenge required a token, so serde failed the
  parse of the *entire* authorization, the `dns-01` challenge sitting next to it
  included, and the relay never answered a challenge it was perfectly able to
  answer. The symptom was not an error but a silence: the failure is retryable,
  so the order sat `processing` for `jobs.max_attempts` while the only diagnosis
  anywhere was one `job_run_retried` line reading ``missing field `token` `` —
  and every client timed out first (certbot with a bare
  `acme.errors.TimeoutError`). `token` is now optional on the wire, where it
  belongs: `type` and `url` are on every challenge object, a token is on the
  token-based types only. **No configuration changes.** Three things come with
  it: a `dns-01` or `http-01` challenge that really does arrive without a token
  is a *permanent* failure naming the type, not a retry, since a CA
  contradicting itself will say the same thing next time; the `bypass` strategy
  now triggers the first challenge it could actually satisfy rather than
  whichever came first, an unanswerable type being the wrong pick when a
  familiar one is beside it; and a challenge missing `type` or `url` stays a
  loud parse failure, deliberately not skipped, so a genuinely malformed offer
  cannot quietly become "offers no dns-01 challenge".

- **The `netbox` IPAM backend accepts a NetBox v2 API token.** NetBox 4.5
  introduced a second generation of API token and made it the default for
  newly-created ones: a v2 token is the single string `nbt_<key>.<secret>`,
  shown once at creation, and authenticates over the standard bearer scheme
  (`Authorization: Bearer …`) where the legacy v1 token used
  `Authorization: Token …`. This backend hardcoded the v1 scheme, so on any
  NetBox 4.5 or later a token minted the ordinary way was refused with a `403`
  — and since `IpamError` has no denial variant by design, that surfaced as a
  retryable `500` on every `newOrder` an `ipam` check guards, with nothing
  naming the cause. The scheme now follows the token itself, off the `nbt_`
  prefix NetBox mints for exactly that purpose, so **no configuration changes**
  and both generations work (v1 stops being accepted in NetBox 4.7). Three
  things come with it: the credential is trimmed, so a token carrying the
  newline of the env file it was read from still builds a header; a value
  starting `nbt_` with no `.` is the key half pasted without its secret and is
  now a startup error rather than a permanent `403`; and a `401`/`403` from
  NetBox names the scheme the token was sent under, which is the one thing the
  answer itself cannot distinguish from a revoked token.

- **An admin command no longer writes log records into its own output.** The
  tracing subscriber was installed for every subcommand, and `[logging]`
  defaults to `acme_proxy=info` on **stdout** — so `acme-proxy account list
  --json | jq` read a `db_migration_completed` record before the JSON on every
  single invocation, `filter show` prefixed its policy with a dozen build
  records, and `filter explain` wrote a `warn` into the middle of the
  explanation it was printing. A subcommand other than `serve` now installs no
  subscriber at all unless it is asked, with the new `--log-level` or a
  non-empty `RUST_LOG`; when it is, the records go to **stderr**, whatever
  `logging.target` says, so stdout stays exactly what a script parses. `serve`
  is unchanged: `[logging]` is the server's log stream and still describes it in
  full. A script that was parsing an admin command's stdout gets only the output
  now — if it was stripping log lines back out, that step is dead code.

- **The panel's list filters no longer empty the list.** Selecting *every
  profile* on `/ui/expiring` showed nothing, while picking one profile showed
  its certificates — the reported symptom, and the same defect on `/ui/orders`,
  `/ui/accounts` and `/ui/audit`. An HTML `<select>` inside a submitted form
  always contributes its name, so the "every profile" option arrives as
  `profile=` rather than as an omitted key; that was read as a filter for the
  *empty string*, and `WHERE profile = ''` matches no row. `/ui/orders` was
  worse than empty: its *any status* option reached the by-name status refusal
  and answered `400`. A blank query filter is now the same as an omitted one on
  both `/ui` and `/api` — as it always was for the CLI, where clap yields no
  value for an omitted `--profile`, which is why `acme-proxy order list
  --expiring-in` was right throughout. A blank `profile` on `POST /api/eab` now
  also means *every endpoint*, matching what the panel's own form already did
  and what the field is documented to mean. No configuration change is needed.

- **Two profiles on the `relay` signer backend start.** A configuration
  mounting two relaying endpoints against *different* upstreams — a Let's
  Encrypt profile beside a commercial CA, or two internal ones — refused to
  start: `two job handlers registered for kind signer_relay_issue`. Each
  backend returned a job handler of its own, and the job registry allows
  one handler per kind, so the second registration was a fatal error; two
  profiles sharing an *identical* `[signer]` section were unaffected, since
  those share one backend. There is now one relay handler for the process,
  dispatching each queued issuance to the backend that owns the profile the
  order was placed against — the shape the CRL prune, the order sweep and
  notification delivery already had. Recovery after a restart also now covers
  every relay backend, and picks up orders on a profile mounted by a `SIGHUP`
  onto an unchanged `[signer]` section, which it previously left until a
  restart. No configuration change is needed.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-26

### Breaking

- **`order show` prints what its own `--json` carries.** It printed six fields
  and the authorization tree — `id`, `profile`, `account_id`, `status`,
  `identifiers`, `expires` — while `order show --json`, `GET /api/orders/{id}`
  and the panel's order card each carried a different, larger set, and the book
  documented two of theirs as something `order show` surfaced. It now prints
  `created` beside those six, then `not_before`, `not_after`, `replaces`,
  `serial`, `cert_not_after`, `revoked`, `reason` and `error`, each omitted
  entirely when the column holds nothing — the shape `audit show` and `account
  show` already had. The layout changed with it: a padded label column, no
  colon, so `id: abc` is now `id             abc`. A script parsing this output
  needs `--json`, which is what it was for.

  One member stays `--json`'s alone and the book says so: `certificatePem`, the
  issued chain, several kilobytes of PEM in a command run to get one's
  bearings. The panel's `chain.pem` download is the other way to it. The three
  URL members (`authorizations`, `finalize`, and the ACME `certificate` URL,
  which a browser cannot follow) are likewise not printed — the indented
  authorization tree is the terminal's answer to the same question.

  `certSerial` joins the order JSON on **every** surface — `order list --json`,
  `order show --json`, `GET /api/orders`, `GET /api/orders/{id}` — and the order
  card gains a `Serial` row and a `Certificate expires` row. Until now the
  serial was printed by nothing at all, while `audit list --cert-serial` and
  `GET /api/audit?certSerial=` both filtered on it: an operator could search the
  audit trail by a value no order rendering would tell them. It is omitted, not
  nulled, on an order that never issued. Listings are otherwise unchanged —
  `order list`'s line and the panel's order table keep their columns, a listing
  being allowed to be a summary where two detail views were not allowed to
  disagree.

- **`account list` and `order list` are paged**, `--limit`/`--offset`
  defaulting to 50 rows, where both used to answer with the whole table.
  `orders` grows a row per issuance for the life of the deployment, which
  reaches a real CA within a year — the reason `audit list` has been paged since
  it existed. There is deliberately no "everything" spelling and `--limit 0` is
  not a way around it. Both now end with `N of M row(s).`, so a page is never
  mistaken for the whole table; `order list --expiring-in` says the third number
  out loud (`6 of 8 row(s), 2 superseded hidden.`) because supersession is
  decided per row and cannot become part of the query. A script that read the
  whole listing needs `--limit` with a number it chooses; the window is **not**
  clamped to `admin.page_size_max`, which is a ceiling on what an HTTP caller
  may ask the server for.

- **`account list` is now newest first**, where it was oldest first. It reads
  the same `Account::search` the panel and `GET /api/accounts` do — a listing
  paged one way and ordered the other is a page control waiting to skip a row.
  `order list` and `audit list` were already newest first.

- **Every paged `--json` listing answers an envelope**:
  `{items, total, limit, offset}`, member for member the one the admin JSON API
  returns. `audit list --json` moves onto it from `{total, entries}` — the
  members are the same information under `items` rather than `entries`, plus the
  window it was answered with. `eab list`, `admin user list` and `admin session
  list` still print a bare array: an operator mints those by hand, so there is
  no page and no total to report.

- **`GET /api/eab` returns the list envelope**, not a bare array, and accepts
  `?limit=&offset=` clamped to `admin.page_size_max` like every other list
  endpoint. It was the one that did not, over a table where revoking keeps the
  row; the book already documented the envelope as what lists return. Ordering
  is unchanged (oldest first), so `/ui/eab` and `eab list` still describe the
  same listing in the same order.

### Added

- **The resolved filter policy, from the panel and in JSON** — `/ui/profiles/{name}/filter`,
  `GET /api/profiles/{name}/filter` and `acme-proxy filter show --json`.
  `/ui/profiles` warned that an endpoint with `challenge.bypass` on has
  `[filter]` and nothing else between it and its clients, and then offered no
  way to read what that policy said; the answer was an SSH session, at the
  moment somebody was trying to move quickly. All three surfaces render **one**
  document, built in one place, so a page and a terminal cannot come to describe
  one policy differently — the default effect, every check with its type and
  stages, and every rule in evaluation order with its condition
  **re-parenthesized**, which is the part an operator came for.

  **This is `filter show`, and only `filter show`.** `filter explain` really
  runs the policy — it executes the operator's `custom` scripts and issues real
  IPAM and DNS requests against an address and names the *caller* chose — so
  behind a session it would be script execution plus SSRF from one stolen
  cookie. It remains host-only and there is no plan to change that. `show` reads
  an already-built policy through four accessors, runs no check and reaches
  nothing outside the process, which is the whole of why it is proposable where
  its sibling is not. Neither new surface has a mutating verb, so neither
  contributes an entry to the CSRF test table.

  One difference between the two front ends is deliberate. The panel serves the
  **live** policy — what the process is enforcing right now — where the CLI
  **rebuilds** one from configuration, which is what makes `filter show` the
  cheapest pre-restart check. `[filter]` reloads on `SIGHUP`, so between an edit
  and its reload the two legitimately disagree, and a configuration that would
  be *refused* is reported by the CLI while the panel goes on serving the last
  good policy. Comparing them is how an operator finds out which state they are
  in.

  Two shapes to know when parsing the JSON: an endpoint with no rules answers
  `"active": false` and a warning rather than a `404` — filtering nothing is a
  state, and the one an operator most needs to be told about — and its
  `defaultEffect` is `null`, because `filter.default` is consulted only where
  some rule was applicable and is therefore not a fact about such an endpoint at
  all.

- **An admin surface for the expiry list** — `GET /api/expiring`,
  `/ui/expiring` and `order list --expiring-in <days>`. `[notify.expiry]`
  answers "what lapses soon, and has anything replaced it?" once per interval,
  into a mailbox; these ask the same question on demand, from a browser or a
  terminal. All three go through **one** operation, so a page and a mail can
  never disagree about what is expiring or about what counts as already
  replaced — the supersession rule moved out of the digest's job type and into
  the shared admin layer to make that structural rather than a convention.

  The panel opens on every endpoint at once, like every other listing, filters
  by profile and by window, and offers a control the digest has no room for:
  hiding the certificates something has already renewed, leaving only the ones
  to act on. They are **shown** by default, because the rows an operator is
  scanning for are the ones with no annotation. The default window is
  `[notify.expiry] lead_days` wherever the digest is on, and 30 days where it
  is off.

  **All three surfaces are read-only, and there is no plan for them not to
  be**: renewal is the client's own ACME flow against a key this server does
  not hold, so there is nothing here for a button to do. On the CLI,
  `--status` and `--account-id` are refused *by name* beside `--expiring-in` —
  the expiry listing is issued, unrevoked certificates by definition and
  carries no account predicate, so either flag would silently mean something
  other than it does elsewhere.

  One shape to know when parsing `/api/expiring`: `total` counts the rows the
  *window* matches and `hidden` counts the ones a page dropped as already
  replaced. They are separate because supersession is computed per row rather
  than in SQL, so the count beside the page cannot follow that filter down.

- **Shell completions and a man page**, generated from the command tree rather
  than maintained beside it: `acme-proxy completions <bash|elvish|fish|
  powershell|zsh>` and `acme-proxy man` each print to stdout. Both read neither
  the configuration nor the database — they are answered before either is
  opened — so they work in a shell startup file and before a deployment exists.
  Because they are generated, they cannot fall behind a renamed subcommand;
  because the CLI is not frozen before 1.0.0, regenerate them on upgrade.
  Installation paths are in the book's Admin CLI chapter.

- **Expiry reminders** (`[notify.expiry]`, off by default) — a periodic digest
  of the certificates approaching their notAfter, as a seventh notify event
  (`certificates_expiring`). `lead_days` is the window and `0` means the sweep
  is never scheduled; `interval_days` (7) is how often a profile's digest is
  sent, and one with nothing to report is not sent at all, so the absence of a
  message is what "everything is renewed" looks like.

  **One message per profile, not one per certificate**, which is the whole
  design rather than a formatting choice: a renewal is a *new* order, so the
  certificate it replaced still reaches its own expiry on schedule, and a
  per-certificate reminder would fire for every certificate the CA has ever
  issued — most loudly in the deployments where the automation is working. Each
  entry instead carries whether something has already taken its place, drawn
  from the successor's `replaces` field (RFC 9773 §5) or from a later,
  unrevoked certificate of the same account covering all the same names, and
  saying which. Both rules are deliberately narrow: a certificate wrongly
  marked as renewed is one an operator skips past while it lapses, where one
  wrongly left unmarked is a line of noise.

  Two consequences worth knowing. `orders` gains a **`cert_not_after`** column
  (a new migration — `not_after` was already taken by the *requested* §7.4
  window, which is a different question with a confusingly similar name);
  orders finalized before it are backfilled by the sweep itself. And a backend
  with an explicit `events` list does not receive the digest until
  `certificates_expiring` is added to it — the default list gains it
  automatically, and sends nothing while `lead_days` is `0`.

- **A `custom` IPAM backend** (`ipam.backend = "custom"`,
  `[ipam.custom]`) — the inventory is an operator script, for an estate whose
  record of truth is a CMDB, a `hosts` file, an LDAP tree or a vendor API this
  server carries no client for. It runs under the same hardening as the
  `custom` filter, signer and notifier (cleared environment, minimal `PATH`,
  `kill_on_drop`): `ACME_IPAM_HOOK`/`ACME_IPAM_CLIENT_IP` plus the same address
  again as JSON on stdin, and one permitted name per line on stdout. Exit `0`
  is "these are its names" (empty stdout being "recorded, and entitled to
  nothing"), exit **`3`** is reserved for "no record of this address at all",
  and every other non-zero exit — like a missing script or a timeout — is a
  retryable `500` rather than a denial, the guarantee an unreachable NetBox
  already had. Two keys, `script_path` and `args`; there is deliberately no
  `sources` (the script is the source) and no `timeout_ms` of its own
  (`ipam.timeout_ms` is the budget, and is what kills the child).

  It exists as much to prove the `Ipam` seam as to be useful: NetBox and
  phpIPAM share a `sources` vocabulary, a transport and a wire status code, so
  between them they never showed whether the trait generalised. This backend
  has none of the three and needed no change to `Ipam`, `AddressNames` or
  `IpamRegistry`. `tests/filters.rs` now runs the same `ipam` assertions three
  times over three backends, and the e2e scenario needs no mock container at
  all.

- **`order.max_identifiers`** (100) and **`order.retention_days`** (30), both
  per-profile. The first is a ceiling on one `newOrder`; the second is how long
  an order is kept *after it expires* before a new daily `order_sweep` deletes
  it, cascading to its authorizations and challenges. See `### Changed` for what
  each of them changes about a running deployment.

### Changed

- **ACME replay nonces are 256-bit CSPRNG values, not UUID v4.** Minted from
  `ring::rand::SystemRandom` and base64url-encoded, matching every other
  non-guessable value in the tree. Closes two things at once: ASVS **V11.5.1**
  (122 bits, and a form the requirement names explicitly), and RFC 8555
  §6.5.1, which requires the `Replay-Nonce` value to be base64url — a
  hyphenated UUID is not, and the same section tells clients to ignore a value
  that is not. Nothing had broken, because no real client checks the shape.
  The four lines that mint it now live in one place, `src/random.rs`, which
  `authz::generate_token` and `eab::generate_secret` had each written out
  separately. The column the nonce is stored in is corrected by the entry
  below.

- **`nonces.value` and `challenges.token` declare the width they actually
  hold.** Both columns store the same value — 32 CSPRNG bytes base64url-encoded
  without padding, 43 characters — and neither said so: `nonces.value` was
  `VARCHAR(36)`, accurate while the nonce was a UUID v4 and false once it was
  not, and `challenges.token` was a bare `VARCHAR`. Both are now `VARCHAR(43)`.
  SQLite gives either TEXT affinity and enforces no length, so **nothing about
  what the server stores or accepts changes**; what changes is that the frozen
  migration set — the one artifact this project guarantees, and the one a port
  to another dialect transcribes — stops describing data it no longer holds.
  The upgrade rewrites the two tables in place (SQLite cannot alter a declared
  type), preserving every row and re-creating `idx_nonces_created_at` and
  `idx_challenges_authz`, which a `DROP TABLE` takes with it. The width is
  derived from `TOKEN_BYTES` in `src/random.rs` and pinned to it by
  `declared_token_widths_match_random_token`, so the next change to that
  constant fails in the test suite rather than surviving as a wrong number.

- **Two `newAccount` requests carrying the same account key no longer race into
  a `500`.** `find_or_create` read then inserted, so two renewals starting
  together — a first boot, or a client retrying a response it thought was slow —
  both found nothing, both inserted, and the loser tripped
  `UNIQUE (profile, pubkey)`. RFC 8555 §7.3 makes find-or-create the contract:
  the loser is now handed the account that won. The same recovery is applied to
  **`keyChange`**, whose lost race became a `500` where §7.3.5 specifies `409`
  plus the `Location` of the account holding the key — and the handler was
  already building exactly that response on the non-racing path.

- **A challenge is claimed before it is validated**, moving `pending` to
  `processing` in a single guarded `UPDATE` — `Order::claim_for_finalize`'s
  primitive, one table down. Two triggers for one challenge previously each ran
  a validation, and validation reaches out to an address the *client* named, so
  N simultaneous triggers were N probes of that host from this server, bounded
  only by `server.max_concurrent_requests`. **A challenge being validated now
  reports `"status": "processing"`** rather than `"pending"`, which is what
  §7.1.6 asks for, and §8.2's `Retry-After` accompanies it. A client that
  matches challenge status exactly, rather than waiting for a terminal one, will
  see the new value.

- **`newOrder` refuses more than `order.max_identifiers` names**, and an account
  more than 32 `contact` entries. The only bound before was
  `server.max_body_bytes`, which at roughly thirty bytes per identifier admitted
  some four thousand names in one request — each an authorization plus a
  challenge per offered type, inserted in a *single* transaction against
  SQLite's one writer. Refused as `malformed`, not `rateLimited`: the order is
  malformed for this server whenever it is sent.

- **Expired orders are deleted after `order.retention_days`.** Nothing pruned
  `orders` before, so it and the `authorizations` and `challenges` beneath it
  grew for the life of a deployment. **A `valid` order is never swept, whatever
  its age** — its row is how `revokeCert` and the CRL resolve a certificate by
  serial, and what RFC 9773 renewal information is derived from. Only orders
  that ended some other way are eligible, and only once their own `expires` is
  that many days behind. Set `order.retention_days = 0` to keep the previous
  behaviour of keeping everything.

- **`x-request-id` is capped at 128 characters and restricted to
  `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`**; anything else is replaced by a generated id rather than
  truncated, since half of somebody's correlation id correlates with nothing.
  The header is unauthenticated input that reaches the `request` span (so every
  log line of the request), the response header and two database columns — the
  ceiling `User-Agent` already had, for a value that travels further. Under the
  non-JSON log format the restriction also stops a caller writing fields that
  were never emitted.

### Security

- **An operator's password is now checked against a common-password corpus and
  against a list of words naming the deployment**, not only for length. This
  closes the ASVS 5.0 self-assessment's only **L1** gap (V6.2.4) and three of
  its L2 gaps (V6.1.2, V6.2.11, V6.2.12), which were one missing control seen
  from four angles. `check_password_policy` in `src/admin/password.rs` is still
  the single place every rule lives, and `admin user create` and `admin user
  passwd` are still the only callers.

  **This is a behaviour change**: a password that `admin user create` accepted
  before may now be refused. Nothing runs on *sign-in* — an existing password
  that predates the rules still works, and a corpus refresh must never lock an
  operator out of the panel they would have to be signed in to fix.

  There are three rules, cheapest first, and each ends the check so one refusal
  names one reason. Length is unchanged. The second refuses a password
  *containing* any word that names this deployment, compared case-insensitively
  and ignoring words under four characters: `acme` and `proxy` always, plus the
  operator's username, the hosts of `server.base_url` and `admin.base_url`, the
  words of `[signer.local_ca.subject]` (globally and per profile) and each
  profile's name — so `acmeproxy2026!` is refused, and a CA at
  `ca.example.com` also refuses anything containing `example`. The third
  refuses a password that *is* one of 13 918 known common passwords compiled
  into the binary; it is whole-string, never a substring, so
  `a-long-enough-password` is still accepted.

  **No configuration key was added**, and no outbound connection: the corpus
  ships in the binary, so the security model still names three request-forgery
  surfaces rather than four. That was affordable only because the corpus is
  filtered to entries of at least `MIN_PASSWORD_LEN` characters — `password`,
  `qwerty` and `123456` are refused on length before it is consulted, so
  carrying them would cost every deployment bytes for a comparison that can
  never run. Filtering the upstream million at twelve characters turns 8.5 MB
  into 195 KB. Provenance, the rank cut and the size budget it was derived from
  are in `src/admin/corpus/README.md`; the word list and its two deliberate
  limits are documented under `## Password policy` in
  `doc/src/operations/webadmin_users.md`.

### Packaging

- Published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/acme-proxy), so
  `cargo install acme-proxy` is now an install path alongside a source build
  and the container image. README and the Installation chapter lead with it,
  and the README carries crates.io and docs.rs badges.
- The published `.crate` no longer carries what only means something inside the
  repository — the book, the vendored RFC text, `tests/e2e/`, the Grafana
  dashboard, the client examples and the `CLAUDE.md` files — taking it from 393
  files to 289. `migrations/` is deliberately still shipped: `sqlx::migrate!()`
  embeds it at compile time, so excluding it would break every install.
- docs.rs now renders a feature badge on the `hsm`-gated API instead of
  presenting it as part of the default build (`--cfg docsrs` plus `doc_cfg`).

### Documentation

- **An ASVS 5.0 self-assessment**, as a new chapter of the book
  ([Security → ASVS 5.0 Assessment](https://acme-proxy.github.io/acme-proxy/security/asvs.html)).
  Every requirement of every in-scope chapter is enumerated and given a status
  at **L2** — 162 met, 18 partial, one gap, 36 not applicable — with L3
  reported as information rather than as a bar being claimed. The evidence
  column names a file rather than a promise: for a control requirement the
  documentation is context and the code is the evidence. **There is no L1 gap**,
  and the single L2 one is V15.1.2, an SBOM artifact; the four password-policy
  requirements that sat there when the assessment was written were closed in
  this same release (see `### Security` above). It is a **self-assessment and
  not a certification** — ASVS is explicit that a verification claim means an
  assessor performed the work, and nobody outside the project has.

  The ASVS 5.0 text itself is vendored under `rfc/asvs-5.0/`, the treatment
  `rfc8555.txt` and `rfc9773.txt` already get, so a claim about a requirement
  can be checked at the revision that made it and the assessment can be
  re-derived against a later ASVS release by diffing. **Its licence differs
  from the two RFCs beside it**: ASVS is CC BY-SA 4.0, not the IETF's terms, so
  those files state their own licence and are not covered by this repository's
  MIT. The share-alike reaches derivative works of the document and not the
  crate, which quotes none of it; `rfc/` is excluded from the published
  `.crate` either way.
- **The `[filter]` examples in the configuration reference and the Profiles
  chapter still used the 0.1.x shape** that 0.2.0 removed, so copying either
  produced a server that refused to start (`filter.enabled is no longer a
  setting`). Both are rewritten in the check/rule shape and verified by
  building them with `acme-proxy filter show`.
- The startup-failure table in Troubleshooting described the pre-0.2.0 filter
  world in three rows, none of whose suggested fixes were possible any more. It
  now quotes the messages the server actually emits, and gains rows for the two
  refusals an operator upgrading from 0.1.x is most likely to meet.
- `[signer.local_ca.subject]`'s six keys and `signer.relay.eab`'s two were
  documented in `config.toml.example` but nowhere in the book — including no
  spelling of their environment variables. Both now have reference entries on
  the chapter that owns them.
- The README's feature list had not kept up with Prometheus metrics, `SIGHUP`
  reload, the job queue or the phpIPAM backend; nor had `src/lib.rs`'s, whose
  architecture map was also missing nine public modules. Both now match the
  book. The README's stated coverage floor (96%) was one point below what CI
  enforces.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-23

### Breaking

- **`[filter]` is now a policy of named checks and boolean rules, and every key
  of the old shape is gone.** The flat all-must-pass chain could not express
  "this address is in the management network **or** the inventory confirms it
  owns the name": everything was AND, there was one instance per type, and the
  two-valued verdict could not tell "policy says no" from "I could not decide",
  so an `or` over an IPAM check would either refuse every request during an
  outage or quietly admit every request during one.

  Each filter is now a `[filter.check.<name>]` with a `type`, each rule a
  `[filter.rule.<name>]` whose `when` is a boolean expression over check names,
  and `filter.rules` lists the rules to evaluate in order. Two checks of one
  type are ordinary; `custom` is a type like any other.

  Migration, key by key:

  | Removed | Replacement |
  | --- | --- |
  | `filter.enabled` | a check per filter, a rule naming them, listed in `filter.rules` |
  | `filter.exempt_paths` | a `type = "path"` check plus a rule |
  | `filter.custom_enabled` | nothing — `filter.rules` already orders them |
  | `[filter.allowed_ip]`, `[filter.reverse_dns]`, `[filter.identifiers]`, `[filter.custom.<name>]` | the type's keys move onto its `[filter.check.<name>]` |

  Every one of them is **refused by name at startup**, from a file or the
  environment, so an unmigrated configuration stops the server rather than
  coming up looking configured and filtering nothing. `acme-proxy filter show`
  builds the policy exactly as startup does, so it is the cheapest way to check
  a migration before restarting.

  `allow`/`deny` on the name-matching checks now take **globs** (`*` is one
  label); the anchored regexes moved to `allow_regex`/`deny_regex` and union
  with them. Regex was the biggest footgun in this section and is no longer the
  only spelling.

  There is no compatibility path, which is the standing pre-1.0 rule rather
  than a judgement about this section: a removed key is deleted and refused by
  name, never aliased. No legacy lowering, no dual syntax, nothing to keep
  tested for ever.

- **The `netbox` filter is now the `ipam` check, and `[filter.netbox]` is now
  `[ipam]`.** Asking an inventory "which names does this address own?" is one
  question, and welding it to one vendor's REST API meant a second inventory
  could only ever arrive as a second filter with its own copy of the policy.
  The question now lives in its own subsystem with two backends, `netbox` and
  `phpipam`, and the filter is the thin consumer that turns an answer into a
  verdict. To migrate:

  - a `[filter.check.<name>]` with `type = "netbox"` becomes `type = "ipam"`.
  - `[filter.netbox]` becomes `[ipam.netbox]`, and the backend is selected with
    `ipam.backend = "netbox"`.
  - `filter.netbox.timeout_ms` becomes `ipam.timeout_ms` — the budget covers a
    whole lookup however many requests a backend makes of it.
  - `ACME_PROXY_FILTER__NETBOX__*` becomes `ACME_PROXY_IPAM__NETBOX__*`.

  `type = "netbox"` is refused at startup with an error naming all three moves.
  The section moved as well as the name, so a silent alias would have left
  `[filter.netbox]` read by nothing while the server came up looking configured.

- **`request_blocked` is now `filter_request_blocked`**, the one event in the
  subsystem that lacked its prefix. `filter_denied` and `filter_failed` keep
  their names and gain a `check` field carrying the *instance* name, so three
  `custom` scripts are finally distinguishable from one another.

- **The structured-logging vocabulary is normalized, and every record now
  carries an `outcome` field.** Log records are an operator contract — the
  monitoring page tells you to alert on `event`, and ~450 names had drifted far
  enough that the advice no longer worked. Two call sites *computed* `event`
  instead of writing a literal, so neither spelling could be grepped back to
  its source; ~24 names carried no subsystem prefix; nine concepts were spelled
  two ways, three of them inside a single file (`authorization_*` beside
  `authz_*` eleven lines apart); and `payload_length` meant base64 characters at
  one call site and decoded bytes eight lines below, which made any threshold
  set on it meaningless.

  Nothing here fails at startup — a log line has nothing to refuse — so **this
  is the one breaking change in this release that is silent**. Alerting rules,
  saved searches and log-pipeline field mappings need updating by hand.

  **New: `outcome`.** Every record carries `outcome = "success"`, `"failure"`,
  `"progress"` or `"advisory"` directly after `event`. This is what
  `audit_log.outcome` already does for the audit trail, for the same reason:
  failure is spelled a dozen ways across the event names (`_failed`, but also
  `_invalid`, `_mismatch`, `_missing`, `_unauthorized`, `_rejected`), so
  `event LIKE '%_failed'` silently missed most of it. **`outcome = "failure"`
  is now the one query that catches everything that broke.** `progress` marks a
  `_started`/`_requested` line whose result is not yet known; `advisory` marks a
  `warn` where nothing failed (`tls_disabled`,
  `challenge_validation_bypassed`), so it stays separable from real breakage.

  **Every event emitted from the storage layer is now `db_`-prefixed** — 93
  names, mechanically (`account_deleted` → `db_account_deleted`,
  `admin_user_created` → `db_admin_user_created`, and so on for everything
  under `src/sqlite/`). The prefix marks the layer; the level is unchanged, so
  what was `info` is still `info`.

  Two further changes that are not renames:

  - `startup_nonce_cleanup_completed` is **removed**. It duplicated
    `db_nonce_cleanup_completed`, which is emitted from the sweep itself.
  - Three events that shared one name now carry a discriminator rather than
    colliding: `db_admin_sessions_revoked` gains
    `scope = "user" | "user_except_current" | "all"` (replacing a magic
    `user_id = "*"`), and the seven admin actions reachable from both the JSON
    API and the HTML panel gain `surface = "api" | "ui"`.

  **Field renames**, for the same "one name, one meaning" reason:

  | Old | New | Why |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `payload_length`, `protected_length` | `*_bytes` / `*_b64_chars` | one name meant both the encoded and the decoded size |
  | `body_length`, `signature_size`, `certificate_length` | `*_bytes` / `*_b64_chars` | a size field says which unit it is in |
  | `removed`, `deleted` | `rows_removed` | one spelling for a delete count |
  | `pubkey_hash` | `pubkey_fp` | `*_fp` for every fingerprint |
  | `session` | `session_fp` | as above |
  | `nonce` | `nonce_fp` | as above |
  | `id` (admin user) | `user_id` | the name the other 21 sites already used |
  | `serial` | `cert_serial` | as above; `cert_id` stays RFC 9773's ARI certID |
  | `url` (database, upstream, IPAM, challenge probe) | `database_url`, `upstream_url`, `backend_url`, `probe_url` | `url` is now the JWS `url` header alone |
  | `path` (filesystem) | `file_path` | `path` is the HTTP request path alone |

  `server_startup` is deliberately **not** renamed: `tests/e2e/common.rs` gates
  container readiness on it, so a change there fails as a start timeout rather
  than an assertion, and it already followed the convention.

  All nine rules are now enforced by `tests/logging_convention.rs`, which walks
  `src/` and fails CI on a stray call site — including one check that reaches
  outside the crate, asserting that every event
  `doc/src/operations/monitoring.md` names is still emitted. That check found a
  pre-existing bug on its first run: the page documented
  `admin_login_rate_limited`, which nothing has ever emitted.

- **The `acme_proxy` signer backend is now `relay`.** It shared its name with
  the program that hosts it — the binary, the crate, the `ACME_PROXY_*`
  environment prefix and the default log filter are all `acme-proxy` — which
  made `ACME_PROXY_SIGNER__ACME_PROXY__DNS01__RFC2136__TSIG_KEY_SECRET` spell
  the application's name twice for two different things, and left the
  documentation glossing the page title as "ACME Proxy (Relay)" to say which
  one it meant. `relay` is what the code and the prose already called it. To
  migrate:

  - `signer.backend = "acme_proxy"` becomes `signer.backend = "relay"`.
  - `[signer.acme_proxy]`, `[signer.acme_proxy.eab]`,
    `[signer.acme_proxy.dns01]` and `[signer.acme_proxy.dns01.rfc2136]` become
    `[signer.relay]`, `[signer.relay.eab]`, `[signer.relay.dns01]` and
    `[signer.relay.dns01.rfc2136]`.
  - `ACME_PROXY_SIGNER__ACME_PROXY__*` becomes `ACME_PROXY_SIGNER__RELAY__*`.

  Neither half fails silently. The old `backend` value is refused at startup
  with an error naming its replacement and both env-var prefixes; a
  configuration that renames `backend` but leaves the table behind is refused
  by the existing "directory_url is empty" check, because the stale table is no
  longer read. `acme-proxy upstream show|register` is unchanged — it acts on
  the upstream account, which keeps its own word.

  The two startup log events `signer_acme_proxy_eab_secret_in_config` and
  `signer_acme_proxy_http01_selected` are renamed to `signer_relay_*`, and the
  three tracing spans `acme_proxy_{issue,revoke,renewal_info}` to `relay_*` —
  relevant if you alert or grep on them. No database, ACME wire format or CLI
  surface changes; `upstream_orders` and `upstream_account.key` keep their
  names, which were already about the far side rather than the backend.



- **A `[proxy]` section: every outbound HTTP request can now go through a
  forward proxy.** Three keys — `http_url`, `https_url` and `no_proxy` — and
  they govern the upstream CA the `relay` signer talks to, the IPAM inventory,
  the Mattermost webhook, and both network-touching challenge validators. An
  `https://` target is reached by a `CONNECT` tunnel and an `http://` one is
  forwarded (absolute-form request line plus `Proxy-Authorization`);
  `tls-alpn-01`'s raw TLS probe is tunnelled too, since a `CONNECT` tunnel is
  transparent under TLS.

  Each key falls back to its conventional environment variable when left empty:
  `http_url` to `$http_proxy`, `https_url` to `$https_proxy` then
  `$HTTPS_PROXY`, `no_proxy` to `$no_proxy` then `$NO_PROXY`. Uppercase
  `HTTP_PROXY` is **deliberately not read** — under CGI a client-supplied
  `Proxy:` header arrives in the environment under exactly that name (httpoxy,
  CVE-2016-5385), and while this server is never a CGI process, Go's `net/http`
  dropped the variable for the same reason and matching it costs nothing.

  Loopback and `localhost` bypass unconditionally, before `no_proxy` is
  consulted: an inherited shell `http_proxy` must not route this server's own
  loopback traffic through a corporate proxy. A configured but unreachable proxy
  is an error every time — there is no fallback to a direct connection, since
  dialling around a controlled egress path exactly when the control fails is the
  opposite of what the setting is for.

  **Not everything outbound**: SMTP (`notify.email`, via `lettre`) and the
  RFC 2136 DNS updates `signer.relay.dns01` makes are not HTTP, dial directly,
  and are documented as doing so. An estate whose egress is proxy-only needs a
  separate route for those two. `filter` is untouched — `reverse_dns` is DNS,
  the `ipam` filter receives an already-built inventory client, and `custom`
  shells out.

- `doc/lint.py`, a style and link gate for the book, run by a new **docs** CI
  job that builds the book on pull requests — the deploy workflow only ran after
  merge, so a broken `SUMMARY.md` entry was previously found too late.

- **`SignerBackend::resume` is gone, replaced by `SignerBackend::jobs`.** The
  old hook took no arguments, returned nothing, and each asynchronous backend
  implemented it by re-spawning its own `tokio` tasks at startup. A backend now
  *registers job handlers* instead, and recovery is one case of a queue rather
  than a mechanism of its own — see `JobHandler::recover`, which is where that
  logic went. This is a Rust API change with no configuration surface; nothing
  an operator writes down mentions either name.

  `MAX_CONCURRENT_RELAYS`, a constant inside the `relay` backend that capped
  concurrent upstream polling at 8, is likewise gone. The number and its
  reasoning moved to `jobs.max_concurrent`, which has the same default and now
  governs every kind of background work rather than that one backend's.

- **The `mattermost` notify backend is replaced by a generic `webhook` one.**
  It was one provider's payload shape (`{"text", "channel", "username"}`)
  frozen into a copy of the outbound HTTP transport — and every other part of
  it, the TLS stack, the proxy, the resolver, the timeout and the
  retryable/permanent status split, had nothing to do with Mattermost. Slack,
  Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Telegram and Matrix differ from it in a URL, a
  verb, a header and a JSON shape, so the way to support them is to make those
  four configurable, not to write four more backends.

  `[notify.webhook.<name>]` entries are **named**, selected and ordered by
  `notify.webhook_enabled`, exactly like `[notify.custom]` — so one profile can
  post to Slack and an on-call room at once, and each is retried independently.

  Migration, key by key:

  | Removed | Replacement |
  | --- | --- |
  | `notify.enabled = ["mattermost"]` | `notify.enabled = ["webhook"]` plus `notify.webhook_enabled = ["<name>"]` |
  | `notify.mattermost.webhook_url` | `notify.webhook.<name>.url` |
  | `notify.mattermost.channel`, `.username` | members of `notify.webhook.<name>.body` |
  | `notify.mattermost.events`, `.timeout_ms` | `notify.webhook.<name>.events`, `.timeout_ms` |
  | `mattermost/<event>.j2` template overrides | `webhook/<event>.j2` |

  `notify.enabled = ["mattermost"]` is **refused by name at startup**, naming
  `[notify.webhook]` and the default `body`, so an unmigrated configuration
  stops the server rather than coming up looking configured and notifying
  nobody. The default `body` is `{"text": {{ message | tojson }}}` — the
  payload Mattermost, Slack, Teams and Google Chat all accept — so the common
  case is a `url` and nothing else.

  Two things worth knowing beyond a rename. The embedded message templates that
  moved to `webhook/` lost their `:lock:`-style emoji shortcodes and Markdown
  emphasis: they now feed any provider, and those render as literal noise in
  Telegram, Matrix and Teams. And a `body` template needs `| tojson` around
  anything holding text — `.j2` auto-escaping is off, deliberately, so an error
  message carrying a quote would otherwise produce a payload the provider
  answers `400` to. Both are covered in
  [Webhook Notifications](doc/src/notifications/webhook.md).

  A `notify_deliver` job queued for `mattermost` before the upgrade needs no
  migration: an unknown backend id already retires the row rather than retrying
  it for ever.

### Added

- **The local CA drops expired certificates from its CRL** (RFC 5280 §3.3). The
  revocation ledger grew for the life of the deployment: nothing recorded when a
  revoked certificate expired, so nothing could ever be removed, and every
  relying party downloaded the whole history on every check. A revocation now
  records the leaf's own `notAfter` alongside its serial, and expired entries are
  pruned at startup and then daily.

  Two rules keep it safe. An entry goes an hour *after* the certificate's
  `notAfter`, not at it — the same clock-skew allowance issuance grants, and
  exactly the window in which a relying party whose clock is behind would
  otherwise accept a certificate this CA revoked. And an entry with **no**
  recorded expiry is never dropped: that is any entry written by 0.1.0, and an
  unknown expiry is not an expired one.

  **The `ca.json` sidecar gained an envelope** to carry a durable `crlNumber`.
  The number used to be derived from the entry count, which pruning would have
  made go *backwards* — and RFC 5280 §5.2.3 says a client meeting a lower number
  than it has cached keeps the cached CRL, i.e. keeps trusting what has since
  been revoked. **No action is needed on upgrade**: the 0.1.0 bare-array form is
  read as-is and rewritten on the next change, resuming numbering above anything
  that format could have published. Keep backing the sidecar up beside the CRL —
  it now holds the number as well as the ledger.

- **`acme-proxy --version` names the build.** The bug report template has always
  asked reporters to run it, but the flag did not exist — clap generates one
  only when the command declares a version, and this one did not, so the first
  instruction on the form errored out. The binary now reports its own crate
  version, which is also what makes "which release is this?" answerable on a
  host where the checkout is long gone.

- **The admin CLI colours its human-readable output, under a new global
  `--color auto|always|never`.** A listing is scanned for the row that is not
  what it should be, and until now every column read the same: an `invalid`
  order, a `revoked` credential and a `certificate_issue_failed` audit row were
  the same grey as the timestamp beside them.

  The default is `auto` — colour when the stream is a terminal and `NO_COLOR` is
  unset or empty — so a piped or redirected run is plain without asking.
  `always` colours regardless of the stream **and of `NO_COLOR`**, which is what
  makes `| less -R` work and is a deliberate departure from `logging.ansi`,
  where neither switch can turn colour on against the other: a configuration key
  is ambient, and a flag was typed by the person reading the output. stdout and
  stderr are decided separately, since the two are redirected independently.

  Colour is **semantic, never decorative**: statuses, audit events naming a
  refusal, `filter explain`'s per-check verdicts and its allow/deny/undecided
  answer, and the standing warnings (`eab create`'s "shown only this once", a
  policy with no rules configured, a reissued set of recovery codes). Labels,
  timestamps and identifiers stay plain.

  **Nothing about `--json` changes, at any setting**, and neither does any
  human-readable line under `--color never` — both are the same bytes as before,
  verified against the previous build rather than argued. What made that
  guarantee structural is that the CLI-only text renderers moved out of
  `src/admin/render.rs` (shared with the web admin, and the JSON one wire format
  two front ends parse) into `src/cli/render.rs`, where the terminal is the only
  consumer. `acme_proxy::admin::render_*_line` / `render_*_text` and
  `print_rows` are therefore now `acme_proxy::cli::render::*` — a library path,
  not a CLI surface, so no command, flag or output shape is renamed.

- **The profile set, each profile's `[signer]`, `dns.resolver` and `[proxy]` all
  reload on `SIGHUP`, and `reload::FROZEN` is down to `database.url` alone.**
  Adding an ACME endpoint used to cost a restart, which dropped every in-flight
  order on the endpoints that were *already* running — for a change that had
  nothing to do with them.

  The freeze was never about the CA files. A local CA is generated only when the
  files are absent and a relay registers with its upstream only once, so
  rebuilding a backend repeats nothing destructive. It was about state with no
  durable home: a `LocalCa` rebuilds its whole CRL from an in-memory revocation
  ledger, so two of them over one `crl_path` would drop each other's entries,
  and a relay serving `http-01` publishes key authorizations into a store a
  rebuild would empty — while an upstream CA is midway through fetching one.

  `SignerBackend` now has a seam for handing that state on. A backend whose
  configuration did not move is **reused verbatim** rather than rebuilt (so an
  ordinary reload does not re-read a CA key, and under
  `signer.local_ca.key_source = "pkcs11"` does not log in to the token again),
  and a backend whose configuration *did* move is rebuilt sharing the **same**
  ledger and the **same** token store as the instance it replaces. Sharing
  rather than reloading from disk is what closes the window the durable sidecar
  cannot: a revocation landing while the reload is still building would
  otherwise be lost.

  Two things fall out of it. Mounting and unmounting an endpoint is now an
  ordinary reload — a `profile_mounted` fires for an endpoint that was not there
  before and for no other, and an unmounted one leaves its accounts and orders
  in the database to come back if it is mounted again. And `dns.resolver` and
  `[proxy]` unfreeze: they were refused only because the signer backends cached
  them at construction, which is now a reason to rebuild a backend rather than
  to refuse the edit.

  One caveat, and it is the only one: unmounting the last profile a `relay`
  backend serves takes its job handler with it, so an issuance still waiting on
  the upstream has nothing left to finish it. Drain such an endpoint before
  removing it.

  `database.url` stays frozen and should stay frozen for good — the pool is
  open, migrations would run mid-flight, and the accounts and orders do not
  follow a URL elsewhere. A different database is a different CA.

- **`[jobs]` reloads on `SIGHUP`.** All seven keys — the poll interval,
  concurrency, the attempt budget, both retry bounds, the lease and retention —
  where six of them used to be refused by name. These are the knobs an operator
  reaches for while something is already going wrong (an upstream CA
  rate-limiting you, a backlog draining too slowly), so charging a restart for
  them dropped exactly the in-flight orders the retuning was meant to save. They
  were never *physically* frozen the way `database.url` is; the runner had
  simply snapshotted them when it started.

  It no longer does. The loop re-derives its pacing from a `watch` cell on every
  pass and resizes its own concurrency pool, and the queue reads `max_attempts`
  from a shared atomic — so nothing in the section is read once, and the runner
  never restarts.

  Each key lands at its own grain, and nothing already in flight is disturbed:

  - `poll_interval_ms` takes effect at once, without waiting out the old
    interval first.
  - `max_concurrent` widens immediately when raised; lowered, it takes back the
    slots that are free and reaches the new figure as running jobs finish. No
    job is ever cancelled to get there sooner.
  - `lease_seconds` and both `retry_*` keys apply to the next job claimed — one
    already running keeps the budget and backoff it started under.
  - `max_attempts` stays frozen onto each row at enqueue, so it applies to work
    queued from then on. Raising it is **not** a way to rescue a backlog that is
    about to give up.
  - `retention_days` rebuilds the sweep, including registering it when it goes
    from `0` to a real value.

  New event `job_runner_retuned`, carrying all five pacing values. It is the
  line worth grepping for: `server_config_reloaded` says a generation was
  published, this says the runner is actually running under it. It is silent
  when a reload leaves `[jobs]` alone.

- **The listeners rebind on `SIGHUP`.** All seven keys that decide where a
  socket is, or whether there is one, now reload: `server.bind_address`,
  `server.tls.enabled`, `admin.enabled`, `admin.bind_address`,
  `admin.tls.enabled`, `metrics.enabled` and `metrics.bind_address`. Moving the
  ACME port, bootstrapping the web admin on a running CA, or turning the metrics
  endpoint on for a new Prometheus each cost a restart — and a restart of a CA
  drops every live connection and every in-flight order for a change that never
  touched issuance.

  `reload::FROZEN` lost every bind address here; the `[jobs]` entry above took
  the rest.

  What made it possible is that this server now owns its accept loop
  (`src/listener.rs`) rather than handing each socket to `axum::serve`, which
  consumes it. One `axum::serve` per listener lives for the process; underneath
  it the `TcpListener` is replaceable and the TLS mode is an
  `Option<TlsSettings>` read **per connection**, exactly as the certificate
  already was. Three consequences worth knowing:

  - **A bad address refuses the reload rather than dropping the live socket.**
    Every new socket is bound before anything is published, so a port already in
    use is a `server_config_reload_failed` with the running listener untouched.
  - **Turning TLS on or off does not move the socket at all**, which is the one
    case a bind-then-drain scheme could not serve — two listeners cannot hold
    one port. The next connection speaks the new protocol on the same port.
  - **Established connections are never disturbed by a rebind.** Only the socket
    new connections arrive on changes.

  `server_config_reloaded` gained `listeners_rebound`, naming any socket that
  moved, and `server_listener_stopped` is new for a listener switched off.
  Switching the panel off releases its socket and empties its router, but does
  not sign anybody out — sessions are in the database; use `acme-proxy admin
  session revoke --all` for that.

- **`[logging]` reloads on `SIGHUP`.** All six keys — the filter, the format,
  the destination, colour, span events and `flatten_event` — where the whole
  section used to be refused by name. Raising the log level or switching to JSON
  for a collector was the one thing an operator most wants mid-incident and the
  one thing that still cost a restart, taking every live connection and
  in-flight order with it.

  The subscriber is installed once per process and that has not changed; what
  changed is that the layer stack now sits behind a
  `tracing_subscriber::reload::Layer`, so a generation swaps it like everything
  else. It is the **first** thing a reload publishes, so the
  `server_config_reloaded` line confirming the reload is already written under
  the new settings. The cost, stated rather than buried: a `reload::Layer` puts
  an `RwLock` read on every event.

  `RUST_LOG` still outranks `logging.filter`, on a reload exactly as at startup
  — the two disagreeing about what the server is running would be worse than the
  override. But that makes an edited filter a silent no-op, so a reload that
  hits it now logs `server_logging_filter_overridden` instead of looking like it
  worked. `server_config_reloaded` also gained `logging_reloaded`, which is
  `false` when the process installed no subscriber of its own and there was
  therefore nothing to swap.

- **A Grafana dashboard**, at `dashboards/acme-proxy.json`. Twelve panels over
  the four metric families: issuance and its refusals by ACME problem type,
  request rate by route and status, the 5xx share, shed requests, unmatched
  paths, and the SQLite pool. Import it and adapt it — it is a starting point,
  not a fixed artifact. See `doc/src/operations/grafana.md`.

  Two properties an operator cannot infer from the exposition alone are encoded
  in it: `route` is a matched route *pattern*, so grouping by it is bounded,
  and the pool gauge carries no `profile` label, so the dashboard-wide profile
  filter must not be applied to it. `tests/grafana_dashboard.rs` fails the build
  if a queried metric stops being emitted, if an emitted family is missing from
  the dashboard, or if the pool panels ever grow that filter — with the metric
  names read from a rendered registry rather than a hand-maintained list.

- **A Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, on a listener of its own.** Off by
  default, configured by the new `[metrics]` section (`enabled`,
  `bind_address`, defaulting to `127.0.0.1:3002`). Until now the only way to
  alert on issuance failure rates was to parse the log stream.

  A **third socket** rather than a route on either existing listener, and that
  is what settles the access question: a scrape carries no credential and none
  is checked, because reaching the port at all is the permission — so the
  control is a firewall rule rather than something this server verifies. On the
  ACME listener it would have been an unauthenticated route on a public socket;
  on the admin listener it would have needed an auth exemption on a listener
  whose rule is that every route but sign-in requires a session, and would have
  coupled metrics to the panel being enabled.

  Four families: `acme_proxy_requests_total{profile,route,status}`,
  `acme_proxy_certificates_issued_total{profile}`,
  `acme_proxy_certificate_issue_failures_total{profile,reason}` and the
  `acme_proxy_database_pool_connections{state}` gauge. `route` is the matched
  route *pattern* (`/order/{id}`), never the URI, and an unmatched path
  collapses to one `<unmatched>` series — a label taken from the request would
  be unbounded memory in the scraper. The certificate counters are driven off
  the same record the audit trail is written from, so the metric and
  `acme-proxy audit list` cannot disagree.

  Hand-rolled rather than taken from a crate: the exposition format is a
  `write!` per series, and every façade brings a global recorder, which this
  tree already refused for `rustls`'s `CryptoProvider::install_default`.

  Both keys are frozen against reload, for the reason every bind address is —
  `SIGHUP` refuses the reload by name rather than applying half of it. The
  counters themselves *survive* a reload: a rebuilt registry would zero them,
  which `rate()` reads as a process restart.

  `Auditor::from_config` takes the registry as a **parameter** rather than
  through a builder, because the builder was forgotten on the serving path the
  first time round: the certificate counters stayed at zero in production while
  the suite passed, since the test harness wired the registry itself and so
  proved its own wiring rather than the server's.

- **`GET /ca.pem` serves the profile's trust anchor**, beside `GET /crl` and
  routed the same way: per-profile, unauthenticated, and deliberately not
  advertised in the directory, since it is CA infrastructure rather than an
  ACME resource. Installing the root a `local_ca` profile generated was
  previously a matter of finding the file on the server's disk; it is now one
  `curl`, and the bytes served are exactly the ones already appended to every
  chain that profile issues.

  A backend with no anchor of its own answers `404` — that is both delegating
  backends, whose anchor belongs to the CA they defer to. Note the route sits
  inside the profile router and so is subject to that profile's filter policy,
  which is the trap `doc/src/filters/path.md` already describes for `/crl` and
  now covers for both.

- **The web admin shows the issued certificate, and offers it as a file.** The
  order card rendered `order.certificate`, which is the ACME *URL* — served by
  signed POST-as-GET, so a browser handed it gets nothing and the field was a
  dead string. It now renders the chain itself, from the column that already
  held it, with a `GET /ui/orders/{id}/chain.pem` download beside it. The order
  detail shape (`GET /api/orders/{id}` and `acme-proxy order show --json`)
  gained `certificatePem` to match; listings are unchanged, since a page of
  fifty orders should not carry fifty chains.

- **The access line names the client.** The server-wide `request` span gained a
  `client_ip` field, so an ordinary request finally says who connected —
  previously only audit rows and a few targeted lines did. It is seeded from
  the peer address and replaced, where `filter.trusted_proxies` says the peer
  is a reverse proxy, by the address resolved from `filter.forwarded_header`.
  Both are per-profile settings, so a request that never reaches a profile
  (`/health`, the http-01 responder, anything admission control sheds) shows
  the peer.

- **Configuration reload on `SIGHUP`, without moving either socket.** Until now
  every configuration change was a process restart, which dropped in-flight
  ACME orders and every live connection — for changes that never needed a new
  socket, like a `[filter]` rule, an `[ipam]` token, a `[notify]` webhook or a
  renewed certificate.

  A reload rebuilds both routers, every profile's filter chain and challenge
  registry, the notification backends, the job registry and both TLS acceptors
  from the file on disk, then publishes them together. Add
  `ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID` to the systemd unit and `systemctl
  reload` works. See `doc/src/operations/reload.md`.

  Two properties are the whole design:

  - **It is all or nothing.** A key a running process cannot change is refused
    **by name** — naming the key, what the server is running and what the file
    now says — and the reload is abandoned whole. A configuration that applied
    the half it understood would leave a running server that no file on disk
    describes.
  - **Signer backends are carried across, never rebuilt.** Not because
    generating a CA or registering with an upstream would repeat — neither
    does — but because a signer owns in-memory state with no durable home: a
    local CA rebuilds its whole CRL from its own ledger, so two over one
    `crl_path` would drop each other's entries, and a relay's `http-01` token
    store would come back empty while an upstream CA was fetching from it.

  Frozen, and so refused by name: `database.url`, `server.bind_address`,
  `server.tls.enabled`, `admin.enabled`/`bind_address`/`tls.enabled`, `[dns]`
  and `[proxy]`, six of the seven `[jobs]` keys (`retention_days` reloads), each
  profile's `[signer]` section, and the set of enabled profiles. (`[logging]`
  was on this list too, and is not any more — see the entry above.) Everything
  else reloads, including TLS certificate paths
  and `admin.template_dir` — a template that does not compile now fails the
  *reload* rather than reaching a browser.

  Every success logs `server_config_reloaded` with a `generation` that counts
  from 1, which is the quickest way to tell a landed reload from an ignored
  one; a refusal is `server_config_reload_refused` and a build failure
  `server_config_reload_failed`.

- **A durable job queue, and with it retries for relayed issuance.** The
  `relay` signer backend used to finish its work in a bare `tokio::spawn` whose
  state lived on its `upstream_orders` row: a restart destroyed the task, and a
  startup sweep re-created it from scratch. That bought *recovery* but never
  *retry* — with nowhere to record that an attempt had failed and should happen
  again, every failure had to be terminal, so a five-second upstream blip
  marked the client's order `invalid` and left them to place a new one.

  Background work is now a row in a new `jobs` table, drained by one runner per
  process (`[jobs]`, `src/jobs/`). The practical differences:

  - **A transient upstream failure is retried** with exponential backoff — a
    TCP reset mid-poll, a nameserver hiccup, a 503, a rate limit, an attempt
    that ran out of time. The order stays `processing` throughout and only
    reaches `invalid` once the attempts or its own `expires` run out.
  - **A CA that states a reason is still believed on the first attempt.** A
    rejected challenge, a refused identifier or an unparsable chain fails
    immediately rather than spending a budget it could never use.
  - **A crashed process no longer needs a restart to recover.** Each claim
    takes a lease, and a lease that expires returns the row to the queue.
  - **A graceful shutdown releases its leases**, so a restart re-claims its own
    work immediately instead of waiting one out.

  The queue is generic: `jobs.retention_days`'s own sweep is the first
  non-signer handler, and it is a self-rescheduling job rather than a fourth
  reaper. Nothing about the ACME wire format changes, and `upstream_orders`
  keeps every column it had.

- **Issued leaves can now say where this CA's CRL and certificate live.** Two
  keys under `[signer.local_ca]`: `crl_distribution_points` writes
  `cRLDistributionPoints` (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.13) into every leaf, and
  `ca_issuer_urls` writes `authorityInfoAccess` with the `caIssuers` access
  method (§4.2.2.1). Both are empty by default, in which case neither extension
  is emitted and a certificate is byte-for-byte what this CA issued before —
  which is also the state every existing deployment stays in until it opts in.

  The URLs are the operator's to name, not derived from `server.base_url`. A
  derived value would be frozen into every certificate signed while it held,
  and would silently stop resolving the day a `base_url` or a profile name
  changed. It would also point at `{base_url}/profile/<name>/crl`, which is
  served *inside* the profile router and therefore behind that profile's filter
  policy — refused to exactly the relying parties the extension exists for.

  Several `crl_distribution_points` entries mean one CRL reachable in several
  places, not several CRLs. Credentials in a URL, a non-`http(s)` scheme, and
  anything the URL parser would normalize (a missing trailing `/`, or the
  leading space an environment list written `a, b` produces) are each a startup
  error naming the key and the value — these are signed into certificates that
  outlive the mistake by `leaf_validity_days`. No OCSP pointer is ever written:
  this server runs no responder.

- **An `eab` check binds names to a tenant.** An EAB credential is minted
  before any account exists and its label is chosen by the operator, so it is a
  handle configuration can name up front — unlike an account id, which is a
  UUID you could only discover after the fact. `kids` pins a credential by id;
  `require_active` makes `eab revoke` reach accounts already registered under
  it, which it does not by default. No schema change: `accounts.eab_kid` has
  recorded this since EAB was implemented.

- **A `path` check**, replacing `filter.exempt_paths` and composing with the
  rest of a policy. It can restrict a path to a network, and it globs, so
  `/renewalInfo/*` is expressible where the exact-match list it replaces could
  not. Worth knowing: `/crl` is served by the profile router, so an
  address-based policy without a path rule silently breaks revocation checking
  for every relying party outside the allowlist.

- **`acme-proxy filter show` and `acme-proxy filter explain`.** `show` prints
  the resolved policy with each condition re-parenthesized, so precedence is
  visible rather than inferred. `explain` evaluates it against a hypothetical
  request across all three stages and reports every check's verdict, the checks
  short-circuited past, and the HTTP answer. It really runs the policy, scripts
  and inventory lookups included, and names what reached outside the process.

- **`mode = "warn"` on a rule** logs `filter_rule_warned` and does not decide,
  so a tightened policy can be watched in production before it bites. Rules are
  a map rather than an array of tables precisely so a profile can dry-run one
  of them and inherit the rest.

### Changed

- **An unknown order status filter is refused by name rather than matching
  nothing.** `acme-proxy order list --status typoo`, `GET /api/orders?status=`
  and `/ui/orders?status=` all passed the value straight to SQL, so a typo came
  back as an empty result — indistinguishable from "nothing is in that state",
  which is a perfectly ordinary answer. All three now refuse it and list the
  five valid values, the rule `audit list --event` already followed. The three
  order/authorization/challenge states are Rust enums now rather than string
  literals compared at thirty-odd sites; the stored strings are byte-identical,
  so no migration and no wire-format change.

- **Notifications are durable, and a failed delivery is retried.** Delivery used
  to be a bare `tokio::spawn`: a refused SMTP connection, a 503 from a webhook or
  a script that exited non-zero was logged once and the notification was gone,
  and a restart lost everything in flight. The only mitigation was a best-effort
  five-second drain at shutdown, which still lost anything slower than the
  budget. Each delivery is now a `notify_deliver` row on the durable queue, so it
  survives the process that wrote it and comes back under `jobs.max_attempts` and
  the shared backoff. Three details are worth knowing:

  - **One row per backend per event**, not one per event, so retrying a flaky
    webhook never re-sends through an email backend that already delivered.
  - **A failure that could never have worked is not retried.** A template that
    does not render, a `webhook_url` that does not parse and any webhook 4xx
    other than 408/429 are refused on the first attempt; transport failures,
    5xx, 429 and 408 go back in the queue. A `custom` script's exit code carries
    no way to say "never retry", so its failures are always retryable.
  - **A lost notification now says so**, once, as `notify_delivery_abandoned` —
    the line to alert on. `notify_delivery_failed` gained a `retryable` field
    and, on its own, usually just means a bad minute.

  No configuration changed: the retry budget is `[jobs]`, which already existed.
  The shutdown drain is gone, along with its five-second bound — there is
  nothing left to drain.

- **The nonce, audit-retention and admin-session sweeps run on the job queue**,
  as `nonce_sweep`, `audit_sweep` and `admin_session_sweep`, joining the
  `job_retention_sweep` that already did. Each was its own `tokio::spawn` +
  `tokio::time::interval` loop and a near-copy of the other two. Three things
  follow: a sweep whose task died is now reclaimed by lease expiry rather than
  being silently gone until the next restart; the schedule survives a restart, so
  a server restarting more often than once a day no longer skips the daily sweeps
  for ever; and there is one answer in the process to "run this every N seconds"
  rather than two. The intervals, the log event names
  (`nonce_reaper_swept`, `audit_reaper_swept`, `admin_session_reaper_swept` and
  their `_failed` twins) and the conditions under which each is scheduled are all
  unchanged. What is new is a dependency: the sweeps stop if the job runner does,
  so `job_runner_started` is now worth watching for.

- The `relay` signer's upstream client and the Mattermost notifier now send an
  **origin-form** request line (`GET /path`) on a direct connection, where both
  previously sent absolute-form unconditionally. RFC 9112 §3.2.1 reserves
  absolute-form for requests *to a proxy*, so this is the conformant direction;
  both already set `Host` explicitly, so nothing routes differently. Absolute
  form is still used, and only used, when a proxy is forwarding the request.
- `Cargo.toml` declares `description`, `repository`, `documentation`, `homepage`,
  `readme`, `keywords` and `categories`, and a `docs.rs` block building with all
  features, so the PKCS#11 module is documented rather than absent.
- Crate-level and module-level rustdoc: the module map now covers the web admin,
  the audit trail and the CLI, and the six modules that had no `//!` at all —
  `handlers`, `extractors`, `sqlite`, `admin`, `middlewares`, `cli` — have one.
  The `notify` payload structs, a plugin-facing data contract, are documented.

### Security

- **Two concurrent `finalize` requests on one order could each be issued a
  certificate, and all but one of them were unrevocable.** `post_finalize` read
  the order, checked `status == "ready"`, signed, and wrote — three steps with
  nothing holding the order in between, so N requests carrying their own nonce
  and their own CSR all passed the check and all reached the signer. Only the
  last write survived. The others were valid, CA-signed certificates whose
  serial reached no row, so `POST /revokeCert` answered `malformed` ("unknown
  certificate"), `acme-proxy order revoke` could not see them, and the CRL never
  learned they existed — there was no interface in the product that could
  withdraw them.

  `Order::claim_for_finalize` now moves `ready` → `processing` in one guarded
  `UPDATE` and hands the caller `rows_affected`, the primitive nonce
  consumption and the TOTP replay guard already rest on. The loser gets RFC 8555
  §7.4's own answer, `403 orderNotReady`, and sees `processing` then `valid` on
  its next poll. The `relay` backend was never exposed (its
  `upstream_orders.order_id` primary key is exactly this guard); `local_ca` and
  `custom`, which answer inline, had no equivalent until now. No schema change:
  `processing` has always been in the `orders.status` `CHECK`.

- **A refused configuration reload printed the HSM PIN, the RFC 2136 TSIG key
  and the upstream EAB secret to the log.** The frozen-key check compares
  `[proxy]` and each profile's resolved `[signer]` by rendering the whole
  section through `Debug`, and the refusal embeds both the running and the
  proposed rendering in a message `SIGHUP` handling logs at `warn`. So editing
  any `[signer]` key and reloading wrote the TSIG key — write access to the very
  DNS zone this CA validates against — into journald and every log shipper
  downstream. Those two projections are now compared by SHA-256 digest: the
  comparison is unchanged, the refusal still names the key and the profile, and
  the value is `sha256:…`. Sections that cannot hold a credential
  (`dns.resolver`, `database.url`) still name the old and the new value.

- **Admin login latency enumerated the operator table, in the opposite direction
  from the one the code guarded against.** The unknown-username branch verified
  against a dummy hash that was *generated* on the spot, so it paid two
  600 000-round PBKDF2 derivations where a known username paid one — a
  single-request, pre-authentication oracle on `POST /api/session` and
  `POST /ui/login`, and double the CPU an unauthenticated caller could force on
  the request the login limiter exists to bound. The dummy is now a precomputed
  constant, so both branches cost exactly one verification.

- **The web admin's step-up password check had no rate limit.** Replacing or
  removing a live second factor takes the account password, but that check ran
  the KDF with no budget and no counter — so somebody holding a stolen session
  cookie could brute-force the operator's password at line rate, and a correct
  guess converts the cookie into a factor takeover (enrol their own
  authenticator, revoke every other session, void the recovery codes), which is
  the lockout the check exists to prevent. Any authenticated caller could also
  pin a core with PBKDF2. It now runs the same `LoginLimiter` sign-in does,
  before the KDF and against the **same** bucket, so guessing here cannot buy a
  second budget. `POST /api/mfa/totp`, `DELETE /api/mfa/totp` and
  `POST /api/mfa/recovery-codes` can now answer `429` with `Retry-After`; the
  `/ui` twins render it as the account card's own banner.

### Fixed

- **Two atomic file writes could rename their bytes over each other.**
  `write_atomic` derived its scratch name with `with_extension("tmp")`, so the
  local CA's `ca.crl` and `ca.json` — written back to back on every revocation —
  both mapped to `ca.tmp`. A CRL rebuild racing a ledger persist could therefore
  land CRL PEM inside the sidecar, which the next startup refuses to parse:
  every revocation the CA had ever recorded, unreadable, because two writes
  shared a scratch name. The suffix is now appended rather than substituted, and
  carries the pid — two processes truncating and filling one temp file in turn
  interleave, and then each renames the mixture into place, atomically wrong.

- **`newAccount` did not refuse a deactivated account key.** RFC 8555 §7.3.6
  requires a `401` + `unauthorized` for any request from a deactivated account,
  and every other path kept it — `signer_account` for the seven order-side
  endpoints and `keyChange`, `post_account` directly. `newAccount` checked on
  neither of its branches, so a deactivated key could confirm its account still
  existed and read its own `contact` list back, either by asking
  `onlyReturnExisting` or by simply re-registering. Read-only and limited to
  that key's own holder, but a hole in a boundary that is otherwise uniform.

- The e2e lab picked the wrong container runtime on any host with
  `podman-docker` installed. The probe tested whether the `docker` command
  *spawned*, not whether it succeeded, so a `docker` shim over rootless podman
  answered "docker" — skipping the `podman.socket` check and the `DOCKER_HOST`
  setup, and failing later with an opaque connection error instead of the
  message naming `systemctl --user start podman.socket`.
- An `https://[2001:db8::1]/…` URL never connected. `Url::host_str` hands back
  the *bracketed* literal, which `IpAddr::from_str` rejects, so the connect path
  handed it to the resolver as if it were a name. The brackets are now stripped
  for the lookup and kept for the `Host` header and the request line, where they
  belong.
- Two French comments in `src/handlers/helpers.rs`, contrary to the project's
  stated English-only rule.
- The `### Reference` entries throughout the book depended on invisible trailing
  double-spaces for their line breaks, which an editor trimming on save would
  have silently broken — and had already broken in twelve places. They are now a
  single line that cannot break that way.
- Several run-on paragraphs in the troubleshooting guide, where
  `Symptoms`/`Cause`/`Fix` lines were rendering joined into one block.
- `mdbook.yml` pinned `mdbook-version: latest` and installed `mdbook-mermaid`
  from source; both tools are now version-pinned, and every action in that
  workflow is SHA-pinned like `ci.yml`'s.

### Documentation

- Four new chapters: **Protocol Support** (an RFC 8555 conformance summary and
  what is deliberately not implemented), **Security Model** and **Hardening
  Checklist**, and **Database Schema** — the eleven tables, their constraints,
  and why `audit_log` deliberately has no foreign keys.
- Fourteen diagrams where prose was carrying branching, positional or state
  facts: the JWS verification pipeline, the order and authorization state
  machines, the relay's two stacked ACME conversations, the filter hooks on the
  request path, the MFA sign-in states, deployment topology, and an ER diagram
  of the schema.
- `[challenge]`'s keys were documented both in the configuration reference and
  in the challenges chapter, and the two copies had drifted. The chapter now
  owns them, and the reference carries an index of **every** section — with the
  seven that a `[profiles.<name>]` block may override marked as such, a fact
  that had not been written down anywhere.
- One voice across the book: sentence-case headings, no numbered headings for
  unordered content, 80-column prose, and no marketing register.
- `config.toml.example` gained a section index and per-section markers for what
  is overridable per profile.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull-request templates, README
  badges, a container install path and the MSRV stated numerically.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-09

First release.

### The compatibility promise

The schema freeze starts here: `migrations/` is append-only from this release
on. See [Compatibility](#compatibility) above for the standing rule and what it
does *not* cover.

### ACME (RFC 8555)

- The full flow: `newNonce`, `newAccount`, `newOrder`, authorizations,
  challenges, `finalize`, certificate retrieval, and `POST`-as-`GET` throughout.
- Certificate revocation (§7.6), authorized by either the order's account key or
  the certificate's own key pair.
- Account management: contact updates, deactivation, and find-or-create by public
  key.
- Authorization deactivation (§7.5.2).
- Problem documents (`application/problem+json`) for every refusal, with
  `subproblems` on multi-identifier rejections (§6.7.1).
- Directory `meta` members, including a terms-of-service requirement that
  `newAccount` then enforces (§7.3.3).

### Extensions

- **External Account Binding** (§7.3.4) — credentials minted out of band, stored
  in the database and revocable without a restart.
- **Key rollover** (§7.3.5).
- **Renewal Information / ARI** (RFC 9773) — renewal windows, `explanationURL`
  passthrough, and `replaces` on `newOrder`.

### Challenge validation

- `http-01`, `dns-01` and `tls-alpn-01`, selectable per profile, validated inline
  under a configurable timeout.
- Wildcard identifiers, accepted only where `dns-01` is enabled.
- Validation is **on by default**; `challenge.bypass` turns it off for testing.

### Signer backends

- `local_ca` — an embedded CA that generates itself on first run, issues leaves,
  and publishes an RFC 5280 CRL at `GET /crl`. The issuing key may live in a
  **PKCS#11 token** (`--features hsm`).
- `acme_proxy` — relays to a real upstream ACME CA, solving the upstream's
  challenges itself via RFC 2136 dns-01, an http-01 responder, or bypass. One
  upstream account multiplexed across every local client.
- `custom` — delegates issuance and revocation to an operator-supplied script.

### Access control

- Pluggable filters, off by default: `allowed_ip`, `reverse_dns`, `identifiers`,
  `netbox` (IPAM-backed) and `custom`.
- Client-address resolution through trusted proxies, with a configurable
  forwarded-for header.

### Profiles

- Several independent ACME endpoints in one process, over one listener and one
  database, each with its own signer, filters, challenge validators and EAB
  policy. Accounts and orders are isolated per profile.

### Traceability and audit

- Accounts and orders record the address and reverse name they were created
  from; accounts additionally record where their key was last seen.
- An append-only `audit_log`, one row per CA action **and per refusal**, carrying
  the actor, address, reverse name, identifiers, User-Agent and request id.
- Readable through `acme-proxy audit list|show`, `GET /api/audit` and `/ui/audit`;
  pruned only from the host or by `audit.retention_days`.

### Administration

- An admin CLI in the same binary: accounts, orders, the audit trail, nonces, EAB
  credentials, upstream registration, revocation, and web admin operators.
- An optional **web admin** on its own listener, serving HTML pages and a JSON
  API over the same operations — behind password authentication, a TOTP second
  factor with recovery codes, session cookies, CSRF and origin checks, and a
  login rate limiter. Off by default, loopback by default, and it refuses to bind
  elsewhere without TLS.

### Operations

- Optional TLS termination on either listener, from supplied PEM or a
  self-signed certificate generated on first run.
- Notifications on issuance, revocation, account and challenge events, over
  email, Mattermost/Slack webhooks or a custom script.
- Structured logging with stable `event` names, request correlation, and an
  access line; JSON output for log pipelines.
- Admission control, request timeouts and body limits on the ACME routes.
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM.
